It has just one evident truth and one essential dogma.\n\n### The One Evident Truth\n\nThis can be written various ways:\n\n- All phenomena are impermanent.\n- All sensation is temporary.\n- No thing lasts.\n- Change is the only constant.\n\nThis is called the evident truth, because it is easy to verify right now. For example, pay close attention to the sensation in your right index finger. Upon close examination it is not a ‘solid’ sensation. It pulses. Blinks in and out of awareness. Each sensation of feeling indicating your finger exists for a moment then dissolves. Your sensation of feeling a body is impermanent, changing from moment to moment. In all your life, you have never sensed a phenomenon that was not temporary.\n\n### The One Essential Dogma\n\nThis can also be written various ways:\n\n- You have free will.\n- You can make decisions.\n- You can act.\n\nThis is the only article you have to take on faith. Fortunately, this belief is easily strengthened by exercising it. That is, as you practice making decisions you will become more confident in your ability to create change.\n\n### How do I practice Min Buddhism?\n\nI recommend [meditation](meditation). Most traditions do too (so I’m not totally casting them off, you see!) for the simple reason that forcing yourself to sit in a boring and uncomfortable way _trivially_ demonstrates the one essential dogma and greatly boosts your ability to see the one evident truth.\n\n### What about everything else?\n\nEverything else that the Buddha taught, flowed from these two statements. Discover them for your own self. You never truly learn anything you don’t experience yourself, so what’s the point of me _telling_ you about enlightenment? If you study the one evident truth using your power of will from the one essential dogma you will arrive at ‘nirvana’ yourself. Anything but the two principles you need is an intellectual distraction.\n\nBut if intellectual distraction is what you seek, you can check out this Min Buddhist interpretation of [Reincarnation](reincarnation_in_min_buddhism).","title":"Min Buddhism","updated":{"$date":"2014-02-10T21:57:18.819Z"},"url":"min_buddhism"}

Assign a mental label to that sensation. Then return to step 2.\n\nI will refer to the process of noticing and assigning a mental label as ‘noting’. Try to get to the point where you can note multiple sensations per second. One a second is a good pace for a beginner. A good way to start if you've only been doing mindfulness so far is by making certain to note every single in- and out-breath that you take.\n\nTo give you an idea of this is like, here is an example of the mental labels I might generate during a typical session.\n\n- in breath\n- right toe\n- right heel\n- left shoulder\n- fantasy ideation\n- stomach\n- planning ideation\n- forehead\n- hunger\n- right palm\n- sound\n- left ear\n- butt\n- fantasy\n- lower back\n- out breath\n\nAs you can see, a lot goes on between breaths! This example is actually noting at only a moderate rate of one per second (thanks to my long practice of mindful breathing, I breath about four times a minute when I’m really grooving). Allow your attention to move as it likes, and just note without judgment.","updated":{"$date":"2014-02-10T21:57:18.824Z"},"url":"insight_meditation_guide"}

Only a few others bother to, since there is a biting downpour. The concrete station isn't greatly improved by the weather, but it provides a roof over the landing platform. I hold my jacket closed as the wind whips my hair into my face. When I can see again I notice a man standing out in the open. He stands there and stares into the sky as the rain soaks him. It seems all the rain in the sky is intent on pouring into this weary vessel.\n\nI look away, I saw that pose of abandonment all too recently, and I'm trying not to think about it. I walk over to a newspaper stand, and find it isn't stocked. I don't find the empty green benches to be very good company, so I cover my head and dart back into the train. My coach is empty. There were very few passengers in there to begin with, and they must have all gone to the diner. I while away my time reading _Atonement_ underneath my wool blanket. Finally, as the train pulls away, someone pushes the compartment doors open. He must have been the man I saw outside, because he is dripping wet. He is also the man sitting across the aisle from me, I now realized. He walks down the aisle in a sullen daze, but that doesn't discourage me.\n\n“Hey, you,” I say as he nears.\n\n“Hi. Is there something I can do for you?”\n\n“Well, actually, I was thinking nearly the opposite. You're completely wet.”\n\nHe looks down, and then up at me again. “So it would seem.”\n\n“Take off that coat and hang it somewhere, 'kay?”\n\nIt takes him a moment, but he gets his coat stowed away.\n\n“Great, now take this,” I say, and hand him my blanket. “And sit down.”\n\nHe sits down and hunches up with the blanket. “Thanks,” he says, and looks down.\n\nI did what I could, so I leave him to his misery and return to my book. The countryside slides by, but it is dark, so all I can see is my reflection, cast in an eerie green by the old fluorescent lighting, and behind that, the man sitting slouched behind me. Some people file back in. After a hundred pages or so I fall asleep with the book still open. I awake briefly to see the man gain a resolute look, and then drift away again.\n\nI wake up with a sore neck. Drowsily I roll my head around a bit to try to reduce the ache.\n\n“I don't mean to interrupt—” the man says.\n\n“Oh.” I jerk my head, momentarily embarrassed. “No problem, really.” I look around quickly. At some point he had changed, and was now dressed in a fresh pair of khakis and button down shirt. My book is sitting on top of my folded blanket and has a bookmark in it. “Hey, thank you.” I gesture towards the seat.\n\n“You're welcome. But thank you, I was feeling pretty shitty until you came along.”\n\n“You looked like you were still feeling pretty shitty after I came along.”\n\nHe bows his head slightly. “That I was. But regardless, I owe you. Are you hungry?”\n\n“Starved, you?”\n\n“Famished. Great, let's get to the diner before it closes.”\n\n“Sure, one sec.”\n\nI follow him into the diner, which is aging if tastefully decorated. We take ours seats in an isolated booth. After we settle in a waiter takes our orders. The man says he will pay, which normally I would have argued, but he seems genuine about wanting to repay the favor. He also has an air of money about him that I recognize from my parents' associates.\n\nI sit there uncomfortably for a while, trying not to be too absorbed in my own thoughts. He breaks the silence finally.\n\n“As much as I enjoy the company of pretty women, I manage to enjoy their conversation even better.”\n\n“Oh, sorry.” I blush. “I've had a long day.”\n\n“I noticed. You read what, three books?”\n\n“Two and half, more like.”\n\n“That's a breakneck pace. So, what do you do…?”\n\n“Aliza. I work as a clerk in a second-hand bookstore, and I've recently started writing again.”\n\n“That seems awfully fitting.”\n\n“I suppose so. How about you? You aren't employed as a rain caller, are you?”\n\n“No, although it seems an awful waste to throw away all that talent, doesn't it?”\n\n“Seriously, though?”\n\n“I'm a writer. You've probably never heard of me though. I don't suppose you've read The Modern Fiction Digest?”\n\n“Yeah, actually I have. What's your name?”\n\n“Take a guess.”\n\n“Well, if you insist.”\n\n“I do.”\n\n“I just hope you aren't Richard Stockholme,” I say, noting his start, “because his writing just makes him seem so full of himself, like he can't stand not to hear his own voice for even a moment.”\n\nHe clears his throat. “Well, you are in luck. I'm Gabriel van der Waal.”\n\n“No, you aren't. You're Richard Stockholme. I recognized you as soon as you mentioned the Digest.” I grin at him.\n\n“Oh. Yeah, I am.” He twiddles with his utensils for a bit. “Then that stuff you were saying...” he trails off.\n\n“I was just teasing.”\n\n“Of course, I knew that. It's Thomas Beckridge that's in love with his style. God, you should see the way he goes on.”\n\n“Oh, but I have.”\n\n“No, I mean, even in person he's just like that. He could never quit talking about what a great swing he took. The man is pathological in his verbosity. Then you have van der Waal, who is such a minimalist. I think one day he might stop using nouns, because they don't convey enough action. I mean, he's used maybe five adjectives in the past three years. You know what I mean?”\n\n“Yeah-huh.”\n\n“It's like the way you have Faulkner, who was too in love with his voice to write a good story, and you have Hemingway, who was too journalistic, and only in the happy median do you have F. Scott Fitzgerald.”\n\n“Careful there, you wouldn't want to make it seem like you are drawing an implicit comparison between yourself and Fitzgerald.”\n\n“No, I wouldn't. But you just did,” he says, and cocks a grin. “I'm flattered, really.”\n\nI must have unintentionally rolled my eyes.\n\nHe looks startled. “Jesus Christ, I'm such a dick, aren't I? God damn, that must be why she left. I couldn't stand to spend that much time with myself, not without punching something.”\n\nI feel terrible. Why is it I always do this? “Hey, look, don't be so hard on yourself. You were stressed out, I understand, and you were just trying to be funny.”\n\n“Trying to be funny is about right.” He picks up his fork, then notices his plate is still empty. Agitated, he puts down his fork again. “And how this must look. My wife leaves me, and here I am, buying you dinner. God, I feel like such a cad.”\n\n“Maybe I should go. I have a bag of pretzels I can eat, so I'll just leave you alone.” I stand up from the table.\n\n“No you don't. I, you've got to understand, I ate the pretzels while you were sleeping,” he said.\n\nI look at him and can't help giggling.\n\n“What's so funny?”\n\n“You look so guilty.”\n\n“Oh. I'm really sorry. Please don't leave,” he says.\n\nI wince inwardly. Connor had said that, and I still left him standing in the dark. But I still sit down. “Don't worry about it. You know, maybe while we're here you could give me some writing tips. It'd be something to talk about.”\n\n“What do you want tips on?”\n\n“I don't know, I just feel like my writing is missing something. I can't put my finger on it, though.”\n\n“It'd be impossible for me to diagnose the problem without seeing some piece of your writing.”\n\n“Hold on.” I rummage through my bag and pull out a wrinkled typed manuscript. “This is weird. Everyone always tries to get their manuscripts read, but you don't actually mind?”\n\n“I haven't read it yet, so I don't know if I mind.”\n\n“Ha,” I laugh nervously. “Oh, and don't pay any attention to my notes in the margins, they are, well, they are there.” I slide the manuscript across the table.\n\n“This might take a while,” he says levelly. He folds the stapled corner neatly and starts reading. Apparently I have nothing better to do than watch him read. Every time he pauses on a word and narrows his eyes, every time the corner of his mouth twitches into a smile, every time he lifts his brow I make a note in my pocket notebook. \n\nFinally he sets it down. “You were right, there is something missing.”\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“Hmm. Passion, fire, fervor, whatever you want to call it. The rest of the story is all there, but it's missing that.”\n\n“So. Well, I might need another explanation, sorry?”\n\n“It's like your story is a perfect simulacrum, but it doesn't move. It just stands there, looking like a person. You've got to give it that inner heat to get it moving.”\n\n“Oh, Stockholme, you and your steampunk.”\n\n“Can't help it, that's what I write. But does that clarify it?”\n\n“I think so, but then what do I need to do?”\n\nHe takes a deep breath and clears his throat. I might be getting more than I bargained for.\n\n“As a reader I want to be touched by a story. As a writer, then, you should want to punch me in the gut with your story. The effect of an event is diminished through text. That's why people who care the most about strife in Rwanda have actually been there, and people who care the most about prostate cancer have had it. As writers we wonder how we can get people to feel with that terrible diminishing effect in action.\n\n“To get me to feel an event even through the dampening medium of text you have to punch with as much force as you can. Trust me, I'm not going to feel the full force of the blow.\n\n“Your sentences should be punchy. If you are writing a sad sentence make it the saddest freaking sentence ever. Hit them with that sadness where it hurts. Try to kill them with words alone. It's hard to imagine anyone killing themselves over a short story, but if someone had I'd want to read that story too--it'd be the best goddamn story I'll ever read.\n\n“Even if you don't manage to kick my ass I'll notice the effort. I'll feel you flailing your arms against the text, kicking and screaming bloody murder. And I'll appreciate your text and your exertion. I'll think to myself, 'Hot damn, she's sweating blood to get me to care, I'd better pay some attention.'\n\n“You know what readers like to taste more than anything else? An author's tears. We're such cunts that unless we can taste your frustration and anger at our apathy in your words we won't even digest what you are saying.”\n\n“So, you practice that speech much?” I say.\n\n“Nope. Okay, maybe a few times. I might have been giving a speech like that for the past three months. But only in empty university lecture halls. Filled with people.”\n\n“I'm sure it's useful advice, even if you didn't make that up on the spot. It's probably better, after all the preparation you put in.”\n\n“But it still feels insincere,” he says. “Let me try this. Write like you are stranded on a sinking ship, and you are screaming for someone, anyone, to hear you before the sea swallows you. Write like you are buried underneath an avalanche, and you need someone to pull you out before the pressing cold suffocates you. Do you get the idea?”\n\n“Write like you were abducted by aliens, and unless you can convince a single person of it then you will be driven mad by the secret of Centauri Psi.”\n\nHe grins. “Write like you need a liver transplant, and if your tear filled pleas can't get a single person to donate a lobe of their very own liver, you die.”\n\n“Write like you are the soothsayer and you must warn Caesar to beware the ides of march.”\n\nSomeone clears his throat, loudly. We turn and see our waiter standing in front of our table, arms loaded with dishes, brows contorted in concentration. “Ooh, ooh, let me try. Write like you are a middle aged man who up to this point has never made a human connection, and this train ride is apparently your last chance ever,” he says with long lilting tones of annoyance. “No, better! Write like you are a waiter who doesn't wish to interrupt, but will spill arm loads of soup everywhere if you can't get either self-absorbed person to notice you.”\n\nWe look around uncomfortably for a while, avoiding eye contact. The waiter looks stricken suddenly, and rapidly sets all the dishes with exceeding dexterity.\n\n“I'm terribly, terribly sorry,” the waiter says.\n\n“Don't worry about it. I thought it was inspired.” I look at Richard. \n\nRichard nods, and the waiter scuttles away. \n\n“Poor guy. I hope he isn't too scared about losing his job. That was really brave in a way, you know?”\n\n“I know what you mean. I'm conflicted between tipping him more so he feels better and tipping him less so I feel better.”\n\nFor a while neither of us talks, and instead we pretend to be deeply interested in our food. I comb through my spaghetti like an archaeologist at a fossil dig.\n\nFinally, after having cut his steak into a thousand small cubes, Richard says, “What you wrote in your story is—it is none of my business—is true, isn't it?”\n\n“It is.” There is a sinkhole in my stomach that my spaghetti can't fill.\n\n“So he's still out there, hoping you'll come back. But instead you are on this train.”\n\nHere I am, caught in the act of running away. “Yeah. Was it that obvious?”\n\n“Yes. The story isn't resolved yet, because you haven't resolved it. I don't mean to tell you how to live your life, but I have to say this, for his sake. My wife just left me, and the numbness is incredible. If I were at home I'd probably be lying in a stupor. You've got to go back to him, find him. It's not fair, being left like that. It is cruel, but unfortunately not unusual.”\n\nI'm suddenly interested in my cheese cake. It is New York style, with strawberries on top and a delectably thin crust. “You are right. I should go back and find him, somehow. I don't have the slightest idea where he lives, but maybe he still goes to our usual spot and waits.”\n\nRichard smiles sadly. “That's good. I hope he has a happy ending. You are writing the story, you realize.”\n\nThe rest of the meal passes in silence. When we bid each other farewell I ask him, “What'll you do now?” He tells me he's going to write like hell to get his wife back.\n\nI'm on the train towards Minneapolis. I look out the window. It's dark, but I can see the counterpart of this train, going the other way, rushing past. For some reason, its visage is focused rather than blurred, like a still life, as though it is running in place with my train backwards. My reflection looks at me from across the divide, riding by on the other train. Behind me, a man sits slouched.","updated":{"$date":"2014-02-10T21:57:18.828Z"},"url":"ghost_train"}

Do you think it'll get busy again in the afternoon?” I say.\n\n“It is nice, gives us some time to get back on our feet, but I'm not sure if we'll get another surge this afternoon,” Bernard says.\n\n“Do you think it was true, what they said?” I ask. In my best radio voice I quote, “Riveted Reader, the last place in Pittsburgh to buy classic editions of Chekhov.”\n\nHe chuckles. “It was certainly an exaggeration then, and now it's an outright falsehood.”\n\n“At least, we _had_ classic editions of Chekhov.”\n\n“I'm sure the other second-hand stores must've had some too.”\n\n“Well, it's their loss. Clearly we were featured because this is the authentic bookstore experience. Happy birthday, Anton.”\n\n“This bookstore even comes complete with a fossilized owner. It doesn't get more authentic than this.”\n\n“Oh, you're not a fossil. You're my dad's age, and I'm not ready to consider him a fossil yet.”\n\n“You sure know how to reassure a guy.”\n\n“I try,” I tease. “Anyway, all the books are up. Do you want me to put away the boxes?”\n\n“No, that's quite all right. I'll handle that.”\n\n“'Kay, then I'm heading off for lunch.”\n\n“Of course, off you go.”\n\nAs I walk towards the door I see Chris, Bernard's other employee, on the way in. I greet him, against my better instincts.\n\n“Hey, off to lunch?” he says.\n\n“Same as usual.”\n\n“Enjoy yourself,” Chris says. He slaps my ass as I pass him through the doorway. I spin and give his back a death stare. I don't want to reward his audacity by making a scene, but I do try to slam the door on him. \n\n----\n\nAt the trattoria I read a draft I wrote last night between bites.\n\n“Not happy with the draft?” Clarissa asks. I'm one of her regulars.\n\n“How'd you know?”\n\n“You know, you were rolling your eyes at it and stuff. Or maybe you're reading someone else's stuff?”\n\n“No, it's mine. The heartache in it is so trite, I can't stand it.”\n\n“Aw, but I bet it's still good even if you don't like it.” \n\n“I don't know, maybe it is.”\n\n“Can't you just, you know, write something else if you don't like it?”\n\n“Write what you know, they say. I don't want to. But it turns out, I can only write what I am.”\n\n“Feeling lonely?”\n\n“I guess so. I pushed a great guy away, because I was still hung up on something from a long time ago. So I feel bad about that, both for me and for him. You make it look so easy, you're never lonely.”\n\n“That's just because I don't get lonely, just, you know, horny.”\n\nI laugh. “Must be nice.”\n\n“Not really. I burn through, like, four of these assholes a month.”\n\n“So you are bound to meet a nice guy eventually, it's inevitable with those odds.”\n\n“I dunno, I don't, like, attract anyone worth it. You get much nicer guys after you than, you know, a lowly waitress.”\n\n“Right, because used bookstore clerk is _so_ many rungs higher on the crappy jobs ladder. The only guy I have after me is Chris.”\n\n“Shuuut up. The same Chris that was in the time I came to visit? He was cute as, like, puppies.”\n\n“Well, you're entitled to your opinions. When I was coming over here today he copped a feel.”\n\n“Were you pissed?”\n\n“Sort of, but I didn't want to give him the satisfaction of annoying me, so I just tried to slam the door on him.”\n\n“Did it work?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Good.”\n\n“Good? It was a damn shame.”\n\n“If you don't like him, just bring him over here sometime, okay? He'll be taken care of.”\n\n“Alrighty then. I just need some way to take care of my writing problem now.”\n\n“You can't change your loneliness by writing, you know”\n\nWhen I get back I ask Bernard if anything happened while I was out.\n\n“I did severely admonish Christopher. If he gives you any more trouble, just tell me, and I'll fire him.”\n\n“Oh, no, don't do that. Chris is working through college, and I bet he needs the money.”\n\n“He had the gall to suggest the story about my father's café made me hypocritical, as if I was doing it myself or some such nonsense.”\n\n“The story about the café filled with beautiful baristas? Tell me that story isn't the basis of your hiring practices. Because if you find Chris attractive, then I'm not sure we can be friends.”\n\n“No, no, heavens no,” he guffaws. “Like I told Chris, the café story is a condemnation of my father's character, not an endorsement of his techniques. It was cruel really, having to grow up there.”\n\n“Why's that?”\n\n“Do you have any idea how hard it is to be surrounded by pretty women who all dote on you because you're their boss's son?”\n\n“I must not, because that doesn't exactly sound like hardship,” I say.\n\n“Oh, but it was. I spent my entire childhood developing painful crushes on these women. It screws you up as a kid.”\n\n“I'm sorry. But you seem to have turned out fine?”\n\n“No. I'll never forgive my father for what he did.”\n\n“What was that?”\n\n“One effect of that environment is to drive a young boy to become witty, if not charming. Eventually they doted on me not just because I was my father's son, but because I treated them well and made them laugh.”\n\n“So you got a lot of practice.”\n\n“Yes, eventually it became a simple thing to talk to a stunning woman. When I was seventeen I fell in love with a new waitress named Kasia, and she with me.”\n\n“And was it a long fulfilling relationship?” I tease.\n\n“It could have been. We married when I was eighteen, in secret.”\n\n“Oh, I didn't know. That you had a wife, that is.”\n\n“Wouldn't be much of a secret, if you did.”\n\nI smile uneasily. “I suppose not.”\n\n“When my father found out, he was furious. He fired Kasia, forbid me from seeing her, had our marriage annulled by a priest he paid, and then sent me away from Poland to study in America.”\n\n“Were you able to bring Kasia with you? Or did you go back to get her?”\n\n“No, she wasn't able to come. And it was eight years before I could afford to return to Poland.”\n\n“Were you able to write to her?”\n\n“After she was fired she had to move, and I didn't get her new address before I left. She probably tried to write to me, but knowing my father he wouldn't have told her my address if she asked.”\n\n“What happened when you returned?”\n\n“I wasn't able to find her when I got back.”\n\n“I'm so sorry.”\n\n“It's okay. I've had quite a bit of time to think about it. The pain is different now, more of a dull ache. Just like getting old, I suppose.”\n\nI know that pain, but I want to let it go. Jonas wouldn't want me hurting for him if he were alive. “I hope I wasn't prying,” I say.\n\n“No, not at all. Thank you for listening.”\n\n“You know me, I'm always collecting stories.”\n\n“Yes, but I want this one to make it into your book.” \n\n“I'll try my hardest to get the book written, then, and include it.”\n\n“That way you can skip the time I almost destroyed my inventory by setting off the fire alarm.”\n\n“I already said I wasn't going to write about _that_.”\n\n“Of course. One other thing, a young man came in looking for you while you were at lunch.”\n\n“That's curious,” I say. I don't want to get my hopes up. “Who spoke with him?”\n\n“Chris did.”\n\n“Where is Chris?”\n\n“I think he is upstairs sorting books.”\n\n----\n\nI find Chris sitting amidst several piles of books. He's categorizing the books we bought off several people unloading their science fiction collections. Heinlein has the tallest stack so far.\n\n“Hi,” I say.\n\nChris looks up. “Hey, what's up?” he asks, like nothing happened earlier. His confidence is grating.\n\n“Bernard said someone came in today looking for me.”\n\n“Yeah, what about it?” he says, continuing to sort while talking to me.\n\n“He said you talked to him for a while.”\n\n“Yeah, what about that?”\n\n“Did you, by any chance, get his name?”\n\n“Conradinorator, or something like it.”\n\n“Something like it?”\n\n“Connor.”\n\nI draw a small breath. “Did he ask you where I was?”\n\n“Sure did.”\n\nI wait, expecting him to go on. Instead, he starts a Carl Sagan pile. I should have known, the one time I want to get his attention he'd ignore me. “What'd you tell him?”\n\n“That you were out.”\n\n“Did you tell him I was at lunch?”\n\n“Nope.”\n\n“Of course not, that would be being helpful to a customer.”\n\n“Aliza, you're not a book.”\n\n“Oh, that's right. I got a bit mixed up for a moment, because you keep ‘judging’ my cover.”\n\n“Yeah, you're bitchier than you look. Guess the old saying was right.”\n\n“Hilarious. You know where I eat lunch, so why didn't you tell him?”\n\n“I know how seriously you take lunch. After all, you never let me eat lunch with you.”\n\n“Just because… oh, forget it. Did you tell him when I'd be back?”\n\n“Nope. Look, how do you know this guy isn't a stalker? He seemed plenty creepy to me.”\n\n“I would know.” Chris is probably just trying to eliminate the competition, but still, it has been over a month since I last saw Connor. Maybe I missed something. “How did he seem creepy?”\n\n“He's going around looking for you? I mean, that's pretty creepy right there—”\n\n“Or romantic.”\n\n“Yeah, maybe you'd think so, but that's a thin line. I'm sure he was making things up when I asked him—”\n\n“Jesus, you were interrogating him?”\n\n“Chillax, there wasn't any water boarding going on.”\n\n“What were you asking him?” I sigh.\n\n“For starters, why he thought you worked here.”\n\n“How _did_ he know I worked here? Wait. You said 'why'. You were pretending I didn't work here?”\n\n“Until I could confirm he wasn't going to murder you, yeah.”\n\n“So he knows I work here, right?”\n\n“Nope, I wasn't able to confirm.”\n\n“Amazing, I can't believe you. So fine, why did he think I worked here?”\n\n“Allegedly he got a phone call from some guy called Richard, and this guy told him you worked here. Sounds suspicious.”\n\n“No it doesn't. I talked to Richard during my trip to Seattle. I told you about him. Stockholme. The writer. You are a fan.”\n\n“Yeah, right, now you are trying to tell me that Richard Stockholme called up this creep and told him where to find you? I didn't even believe you when you said you talked to him on the train.”\n\n“Well, apparently he did.” That is the problem with confiding in writers, they can't stop telling stories, and in this case, changing the story. He probably looked Connor up in the phone book the moment he got home. “So, great, what else did you bother him with?”\n\n“You know, you really should be more grateful that I'm looking out for your safety.”\n\n“I guess I should be, because you'd be an enormous help if I were ever in danger.”\n\n“Did I already tell you I was taking karate classes? But get this, I asked him how he knew you and it set off alarm bells. First he was really shifty about it, like people always are when they are trying to make something up. And then he came up with this totally ridiculous story. Like, you wouldn't even believe how stupid this story was.”\n\n“Let me guess, he said we met each other randomly very late one night when we were both out walking, and after that we started meeting regularly at night.”\n\n“Yeah! And you want to know the most unrealistic part? He said you guys would spend the entire night together and he wasn't banging your brains out.” \n\nI choke on my own spit and cough harshly.\n\n“That's just totally unbelievable, I mean if I spent that long with you at night I'd—”\n\n“Don't! No one needs to hear that. And damn, would you stop projecting?”\n\n“Gawd, sorry. So how'd you guess correctly?”\n\nHe must be deliberately dense at times like these, and I'm getting impatient. “Really now? Because it happened, is how I guessed.”\n\n“I don't buy it.”\n\n“I'm past caring at this point. Were you able to scare him off forever?”\n\n“Actually, he wanted me to help him find a book, since he was here already.”\n\n“What book was it? Did you actually help a customer for once?”\n\n“Of course I did. What kind of employee do you take me for? Anyway, he was looking for _Lolita_. I'm telling you, creepy dude, creepy book. But look, stop asking me questions. I'm just trying to protect you.”\n\n“Okay. Well, I'm going now.” No point in continuing this charade if he's being coy.\n\n“Wait, don't you want to know the rest? Why he wanted to find you, what he thought of you, that kind of stuff?”\n\n“Not really.” My turn to act disinterested.\n\n“Awesome, see you later,” he says. I scrutinize him. He seems relaxed now. If he was deliberately withholding, why would he be relaxed? Does he actually know something he doesn't want me to know?\n\nI stew for half an hour downstairs. Maybe I'm overcomplicating things. Chris isn't so complex, if he sees Connor as competition of course he'll react belligerently. Maybe trying to protect me. From what though?\n\n----\n\n“No, I shouldn't tell you.”\n\n“Please?” I'm beginning to feel too tired for exasperation.\n\n“Nope. He was quite adamant that you not know.”\n\n“Come on, please.”\n\n“Swear it, he said. Swear you won't tell her.”\n\n“Just, come on. I know you don't care about that.”\n\nHe smiles, like he'd just done something clever. “Okay, fine, I'll tell you.”\n\n“Thank you.” I say with a deep breath.\n\n“He said he came to get even with you.”\n\n“No, he couldn't have.”\n\n“He said that you were a horrible bitch, and he couldn't stand it.”\n\n“No, no way, please tell me you're making this up.” I'm feeling faint.\n\n“After it set in, what you'd done to him, he couldn't believe how you'd strung him along and then dumped him just like that. He's been looking for you ever since, to tell you how wrong you were and how shitty you made him. I hope you're happy now, you made me break my vow.”\n\n“I'm not happy.” I turn away, so he can't see me crying. That's what I get for letting my hopes up. \n\n“I'm sorry, but I warned you,” Chris says.\n\nI walk down the stairway very carefully. I feel unsteady, on an intoxicating mix of weariness and grief. I keep having to stop and wipe my eyes. I hide behind the counter with my cash register and sit, hugging my knees. I'm getting my skirt wet with tears. I'm trying to be quiet, but my knees only muffle so much.\n\n“Aliza? Are you all right?” Bernard asks.\n\nI wipe my eyes and look up. I try to smile, but the corners of my lips rebel. “I'm great. Fine.”\n\n“No you aren't.” He sits down next to me. “Tell me what's wrong.”\n\n“Bernard, what if a customer comes in?”\n\n“They can wait. You need attention. What are you thinking about?”\n\n“Your story, I guess.”\n\n“I'm sorry if it upset you. I've gotten better, really.”\n\n“Not that much better. You don't need to sugar coat it for me. I was in love with a boy once. We started dating when I was sixteen. I stopped reading romance novels then, because what we had was better than anything I'd read. But he passed away.”\n\n“I'm very sorry. How old were you when it happened?”\n\n“Nineteen.”\n\n“It must have been hard on you at that age.”\n\n“It would've been hard at any age. I quit attending class for a semester before I could get a hold of myself. And even then, well, you know me as reserved, as does everyone nowadays.”\n\n“Was Chris saying something insensitive?”\n\n“Of course, but he was only the messenger.”\n\n“But what was the message?”\n\n“The guy who came in, Connor, is the only person besides you to have heard this story from me. He'd expressed feelings for me, and I wasn't ready at that point. I couldn't just brush him off, you know? So I told him the story, and I tried to explain why it was too soon. I told him I never wanted to see him again.”\n\n“So Connor's who you've been looking for after your trip to Seattle?”\n\n“Yes, that's right.”\n\n“But he came here, so what's the bad news?” Bernard smiles broadly. \n\n“He came here looking to get even with me, and I deserve it.”\n\n“What? That's odd, that's not how he seemed to me.”\n\nFor a moment my hope returns. “Did Connor buy a book while he was here?”\n\n“He did, in fact.”\n\n“You rang it up?”\n\n“I did.”\n\n“Was it Nobokov?”\n\n“Yes, it was.”\n\nAgain, I'm such a fool for optimism. I bury my face in my skirt again.\n\n“He bought a 1979 translation of _An Invitation to a Beheading_.”\n\n“What, not _Lolita_?”\n\n“That's exactly what I asked him too. He said he likes reading an author's lesser known works. He thinks an author's most significant work is never their best known work, because their most known work has a universality of experience that makes it accessible to a wide audience. Whereas their lesser known works people can have trouble relating to. They are more personal, less universal, and more specific. They carry the most significance to the author—”\n\nA sob turns into a laugh, I'm grinning now. “My God, I should have known Chris was lying. It's so absurd now. You're describing the Connor I actually know.”\n\n“Does he always theorize like that?”\n\n“Yes, and I rather like it. He's very contemplative. But did I interrupt you? I'm feeling much better now.”\n\n“He was saying the fine point of being a writer is balancing personal significance with universal motifs. He said the most powerful story you'll ever read is one most directly addressing your existence. So he's reading every author's most personal and specific writing to see if any of them will connect with him, by chance. And if one does, it'll be the full experience.”\n\n“I miss the conversations. Did Chris scare him off? I can't imagine Chris was being very helpful.”\n\n“It's okay, I wrote a note and stuck it in the book. I told where to meet you for lunch next week.”\n\n“Thank you so much, I owe you.” I hug him tight.\n\nHe pats my back. “Not too hard, dear, I'm glad you are so much better now,” he gasps. \n\n“Thanks. Now I need to go have a talk with Chris.”\n\n----\n\n“Chris.” He's still sorting out the stacks, but Asimov is winning now.\n\n“You look better, did you get over him finally?”\n\n“No, but I realized what you did.”\n\n“What did I do, exactly?”\n\n“Lie to me.”\n\n“Sorry about that, then.”\n\n“Why'd you even say that he bought _Lolita_? That's stupid. You know reading that book doesn't automatically make you a pedophile, don't you?”\n\n“It seemed like a better idea at the time. Was it all that gave it away?”\n\n“Well, no. Okay, fine, yes.” \n\n“You don't have to look so embarrassed, I'm a theater major after all. I'm supposed to be good at that.”\n\n“You fooled me.”\n\n“I know it. Hook, line, and sinker.” He grins.\n\n“But in retrospect, you were acting unbelievably dense.”\n\n“But it was believable. You believed it. I knew you'd be pissed at me after I felt you up, so you'd be ready to assume the worst of me. Acting like a moron just played into your annoyance at me, heh.” \n\n“You're an asshole.”\n\n“Damn straight. But I'm no idiot.”\n\n“Why the fuck would you do that to me?”\n\n“Chillax. Look, I saw Bernie stick in that note, so you'd figure it out eventually. Possibly he'd give you a heart attack when he showed up at lunch. That would have been worth it alone. I wasn't being a dick to him. I did check him out, and he seemed cool, so I talked up what a great chick you are. You know, I know you could probably have me fired at any moment. Either you're a masochist, or you don't want me starving. That's nice.”\n\n“That still doesn't explain why the hell you would screw with me like that,” I say, but my voice has lost its edge.\n\n“Why not? Look at you people. You go through your lives making them into fiction. You take unrelated events in your lives and you invent causality and explanations, and suddenly you have significance. You delude yourself about why things happen, and you build yourself a beautiful drama. I figure, screw that, I'm going to make fiction out of other people's lives. The stories they come up with suck. I could introduce way more drama. Tension. Emotion, turmoil, resolution. Think how boring it would have been if Connor just came in, and you missed him. Missed connections, they happen every day. The cute girl on the subway looks me in the eye and then steps off the train into space. That's a triviality. I made your triviality memorable.”\n\n“You're sick, I hope you know that. It isn't right to toy with emotions like that.” I turn toward the stairs.\n\n“Why? Because I dare to craft in people what you only manage to write with words? Isn't that what you are trying to do, anyway? Manipulate emotions with your words? Cause people to feel what they aren't feeling?”\n\nI'm halfway down the stairs. I shout behind my back, “What I do is share myself, not steal something belonging to someone else.”\n\n“Enjoy your fucking lunch!”","updated":{"$date":"2014-02-10T21:57:18.828Z"},"url":"an_invitation"}
,{"_id":"WHCnYvaPwvjqkyMKo","active":true,"name":"0","prose":"b3XseaYiav4KZoADB","text":"Richard strode away from the rapidly dispersing caravan with powerful steps. This was it, he was done with military service. Now and forever, he thought with relief. Besides the sooty looking guard who had saluted, there was no hero's welcome. I suppose that only makes sense, given how little was accomplished, he thought. As the sun cast its light over his tall frame his shadow looked vaguely menacing, but he shrugged it off.\n\nHe looked up and beheld the city before him. The use-worn city gates were set on a point of high elevation, and they allowed him an overview of Dolinsk. Richard was surrounded by a vibrant city of deep ringing bells, purple dyes, and sandstone. Here the softness of dyed silk was exchanged for the tinkle of coins, and the movements of passion intermingled with the actions of commerce. Life clung to every nook of the old stone, as birds nested in belfries, and ivy engulfed pillars whose paint had long chipped off. Beneath crumbling archways, and between stained towers, people lived. But in the midst of all this, Richard's mind was focused on a single prospect.\n\nAla was petite, to use her own description, but she held herself with such poise that she seemed to fill the vacancy around her with a certain fullness. Richard smiled at her, framed in a curved doorway. \n\nThey were as different as snow and earth. Her complexion had remained creamy after all the years, his had matured under the sun and the weather. Her hair was light and golden and fell to her shoulder, his was black as coal and sprang in unruly thick curls. She was light, and he solid and steadfast. And he loved her with all his heart. \n\n“I missed you,” Richard said. He smiled, eyes crinkling up. But Ala didn't return his smile. “What is the matter?” he asked as she turned away. \n\n“Richard, it's over. I'm not seeing you any more,” she said, pausing. \n\n“What? But why?” \n\n“You were away for too long, you were never there for me,” she said with a little more emotion than she had intended. \n\n“Ala, I'm here for you now. I won't be going away. I'm done with the military for good,” he said. \n\n“And how do you expect to support me, much less yourself?”\n\n“I—”, he paused. “I hadn't thought about it,” he finished at last, but without shame.\n\n“Of course you hadn't thought about it. You don't. I've been supporting myself here all this time,” she snapped, the daggers flying. \n\n“How did you manage?” he asked. He didn't care to take a guess, the obvious answer hurt too much. Her silks whispered of a comfortable life, a pampered life, the kind of a merchant prince could provide.\n\n“Oh, I certainly have my ways,” she laughed as she walked away. That laugh, he had lived for it, it was like the melody of a chime as the spring breeze blew past. Ala gave him one last look over her shoulders, and he admired the elegant arch of her neck and her round face, and quickened her pace. \n\nSighing, he leaned against the sandstone door frame and watched her green skirts sway off. Suddenly his rough–spun and unkempt uniform seemed shoddier than usual. The proud maroon had long since faded away, and was now just a tired brown. It's no wonder, he thought dejectedly. But the earth will always wait for the snow to fall even after its embrace melts away. \n\nAs he drudged home he cursed to himself. So my uniform is a bit worn, but it has certainly been of more service than silk could've been, he thought. He walked through the streets with tunnel vision, not bothering to glance at the stalls of tingleberry or fragrant nutmeg, despite the hawker's best efforts. I'm being absurd. After everything, what I have trouble dealing with is my clothing? It had been so much worse. It wasn't uncommon for the army to suffer heavy casualties, and Richard had buried more than his share of friends. \n\nBut this time had been different. For every ten soldiers who embarked on the deadly northern campaign only two returned. I've been lucky enough to have the honor of burying my fellows, what luck, he reflected darkly. At first spirits were high. The fighting had gone well, and the daily skirmishes against the hillmen and their animal shamans weighed heavily against the hillmen's favor. But it changed when the army advanced up the plains and into the mountain slopes. They were unfamiliar with the landscape, and the hillmen, whose nimble horses were bred for the steppes, were able to kill and injure many in hit and runs. The fighting was slow and toilsome, each inch was hard won, and important areas such as valley passes were slaughter grounds.\n\nBut that was nothing compared to the terror of the plague. It had appeared out of nowhere, and cut through both armies like a searing obsidian blade. In three days fighting had become impossible, and the dead burned on scattered pyres, the smell of burning flesh pervaded everything. Blacklung, they called the plague. The victims coughed and coughed and coughed up blood and specks of their lungs. And their lungs and blood turned as black as unadulterated sin. It was as if they coughed all the pigment out of their bodies, and along with it, their lives. It was even worse on the battle field. Those with blacklung found their wounds did not seal, and the leaking black blood leeched all their strength. The battlefields stank of death so vilely every carrion scavenger in the area congregated to eat their last meal, a giant feast of celebrated death. \n\nThey had beat a hasty retreat. Too scared of an ambush, they didn't bother to bury the bodies, instead they left a macabre black trail, like an inkline across a map. It was little surprise no one stuck around long after the caravan had finally reached Dolinsk, everyone was dying to put the experience behind them, or dying.\n\nRichard was of the former category, and he arrived home shortly. The apartment he shared with his younger sister, Milli, was in a squat three story redbrick building with generous windows that welcomed the light. As he stood in front of the courtyard entrance he noted that the gate still hadn't been repaired. Everything is back to normal, I suppose, he thought, with more humor than he knew he had in him. He had to crouch to get up the stairs, but he did get to the third floor hallway. \n\nRichard reached for the brass knob, but before he got there the door busted open and there was a flurry of soft brown curls. He laughed as Milli barely reached her arms around him. She had their mother's figure, where Richard had his father's figure. Small, pretty, and slim, Richard loved his little sister to death. Their only common feature were their deep green eyes, which met briefly. \n\n“I'm so glad you are back, I missed you dearly. I saw you coming through the courtyard, and I just had to surprise you,” she said, breaking the embrace. Now that Richard had a better view of her he was surprised. I've forgotten she is almost seventeen, she has always been that sweet little girl with dirty kneecaps in my mind, he thought, she will be popular with the boys no doubt. This was the reason he never had her see him off on a new campaign; he didn't want any of the shadier fellows getting any ideas. \n\n“I'm glad too. I tried writing you a letter, but the riders were ambushed,” he said.\n\n“Don't worry about it. But you look a bit unhappy. Did you see Ala?” she asked.\n\n“Maybe we’ll talk about that sometime later, please.”\n\n“That's fine. Come on in, I've cooked a lamb stew with carrots, onions, and roundroots. All fresh, or so Tambly tells me,” she laughed. He followed her in, and closed the door, happy to shut out the world. He took a deep long breath.\n\n“That stew smells fantastic.”\n\n----\n\nMichael darted out the doorway, into a corner, and emerged walking nonchalantly. There was no point in becoming associated with the Murky Lantern if you could possibly avoid it. His plain black hair and only slightly handsome features let him blend back in with the crowd with ease, and he slackened his pace to think a little. \n\nMichael figured he was a good judge of people, and based on that assumption, something was definitely going on. Some recently returned veteran (or sucker, as Michael liked to call the volunteers) had blabbed a fine tale after a few drinks of ale at the Chipped Tankard, and it had been a popular story, if only a story. But he wasn't the only one, and the alehouses were awash in the stories, if the Murky Lantern was any indication. So something must be up, thought Michael, and I'm going to profit out of it. He scoffed at his fellow lowlifes, they lacked so much imagination. Sure, they had invented wondrous tales of the plague's origins. It was born of a demon prince's recurrence, or a shaman conjured it from the stomach of a stripedback spider, or it was the result of an incest between a man and a goat, never mind how the two could have been related. Wonderful storytellers to be sure, but they lack that certain criminal touch. Which is why Michael was headed to the nearest southern herbwoman's tent. The methodist surgeons were great for some things, sure, but when it came to remedies that could be carried and sold, they couldn't compete with the stingy collection of midwives and quacks that were the herbwomen. \n\nMichael slipped his slender form into the crowd, and emerged on the other side of the busy market. He surreptitiously eyed some trinket stalls, but he made the calculation that he had better things to do. Now was the tricky part. He was still concealed by the flow of people around him, so there was no hurry. A bit of a problem here. How am I going to get the specific remedy? Never mind, he thought as he figured it out. \n\nHe strode up confidently to the tent, changing his posture and his stride. He was a different person by the time he reached the tent flap. \n\n“Hey granny,” he shouted as he stuck his head in the tent. \n\n“You! Get out! I'll talk to you outside, no peeking,” the thin and aged herbalist squawked at him. He waited for her to shuffle to the door-flap. She hobbled all the way out of the tent to talk to him. \n\n“What do you want, you?” she asked snappily. I suppose I won't feel guilty, the way she is acting, Michael thought to himself. \n\n“It's like this, granny. Suppose there was an illness that caused your lung to shrivel and blacken, and your cough to bring up your blood, which was now black. Would you be able to cure it?” Michael ventured. Hopefully she is egotistic in addition to just bitchy.\n\n“Bhah. To be sure. You northerners have no idea what sickness is like,” she scoffed. “Fifteen king's coins, that'll be.”\n\n“Look here, grandma, you prepare it, put it in a leather poach, and call me in to get it when you are done. For that I'll give you 18 king's,” he said rapidly, looking her in the good eye. She faltered for a moment, then grumbled as she wobbled back into the tent. Once she was out of sight he darted to the back of the tent and waited.\n\nNot seven minutes later he heard her.\n\n“Yoohoo, come in and get your damned powder.”\n\nThis is it. From his belt he extracted his dagger in a practiced motion, and whipped it across the back of the tent. He slid into the new opening of in the tent, relieved to find the old lady still outside calling for him. He easily found the bag on top of the table. It's almost too easy, he thought as he scooped up a sack of coins as well. Turning, he dashed out the tent and waltzed madly into the streets before the herbwoman could here the faint jingle of coins lost in the distance. \n\n----\n\nRichard sweat slightly under the damp heat, and beads of perspiration collected under his curled hair. It was too hard to think in the damn heat. Up in the north, during the campaign, was different; there the evergreens seemed to steal all the warmth, and the place was in a constant chill. That hadn't been bearable either, he supposed. There were a lot of things he had supposed. Home was supposed to be better than this, not just a continuation of the killing fields. His thoughts were both interrupted and accentuated by Milli's cough. It was a sharp, red, wet, and long cough. The kind that came with blacklung. The rumor was that blacklung was spread by some eastern trading caravan, but Richard knew better; he knew far better, and the guilt crushed him.\n\nRichard shifted his large frame uncomfortably in response to Milli's discomfort, and his tiny stool creaked in sorry protest. It was disconcerting feeling so helpless. There was nothing he could possibly do for Milli, yet he felt like he must try. There had to be a cure, he thought, but then, it would be very expensive. Soldiering didn't pay nearly well enough, he thought sullenly. Ala was right about one thing, he wasn't ready to support anyone. He felt listless.\n\n“I'll be back Milli, I'll try to find something for you, and maybe things will be better”, he said, but his heart wasn't in the words. Words of encouragement, although he didn't think that they were the least bit encouraging. His sister couldn't speak, all she could do was weakly nod her head. \n\nThe markets were not as crowded with merchants as usual, but those that were open made up what they lacked in numbers with intensity. The gloom of disease hung over Dolinsk, and those assembled in the market wanted nothing better than to sell and get out as quickly as possible. Richard watched the market carefully. Force of habit, perhaps. Little of interest occurred, because Richard wasn't interested in the desperate selling going on. An entire fruit stand, stocked with sticky berries, was sold for fifteen gold king's coins. A trained monkey was bought for what was thought to be a bargain, until it began coughing. But something, or rather someone caught Richard's eye among the market activity. Richard spat as he watched a black haired youth plunder a stall under its owner's nose. \n\nPetty theft in a time when the city is dying from the inside, Richard thought. Richard felt angry at the youth. But then, at a time when the city dying, what difference does it really make? Richard wasn't sure how to answer his own question, but just then Michael strode past. Not missing his opportunity, Richard leaped and lunged at Michael. Michael only had the time to be startled when Richard bore him straight into the ground with an audible impact. Mostly audible was the bag of gold clashing with itself. Michael drew his dagger, but Richard caught his wrist and twisted it until the sinews strained. Michael cursed and dropped the dagger, and quit resisting. \n\n“What on earth are you doing?” Michael demanded. \n\n“Don't be sly. I saw what you were doing. A thief are you?” Richard said through gritted teeth.\n\n“Not so loud! So I'm a thief, what about it?”\n\n“It is wrong. You are coming with me,” Richard said as he hoisted Michael up.\n\n“What? You can't be serious,” Michael said in disbelief. One look in Richard's eyes told him otherwise. Richard grabbed Michael's arms and folded them behind his back, into an arm hold. Michael winced slightly as Richard applied some pressure. \n\n“Look, you don't have to drag me around like this. I'll come willingly if you just let me go. I won't try anything,” Michael said with less composure than he had hoped. Ridiculous that I can't compose myself in a time like this, my profession considered, he thought to himself. He honestly didn't think there was much point in trying anything, since he was quite sure Richard was capable of running him down. \n\n“We'll see about that, if I get tired of it,” Richard said as he marched Michael down the streets. The plague had definitely taken its toll. The streets were quiet except for the occasional worried parent rushing to be somewhere. The birds still sang, and the plants still grew, but children no longer played in the courtyards or explored the tops of archways. Richard was dismayed as he walked through Dolinsk. So many alleys and backways now lead to vacant and inviting stone. Meanwhile Michael grew increasingly uneasy. \n\n“Just where are you taking me?” he ventured, a bit after Richard had loosened his grip on Michael's arm. \n\n“To the dungeon, where else?” he said as they walked past a dry fountain, the granite king no longer gushing water from his helmet. \n\n“No, no, no, you can't take me there,” Michael said, panic in his words.\n\n“And why not?” Richard asked, genuinely curious. \n\n“It's no longer a place where people are held. It is a place where people go and die. It isn't even guarded anymore, it's so filthy. They say that the stench of death is so strong that you faint when you are first put in. And it's only a matter of time until you get sick, coughing away with everyone else down there, your screams echoing on the walls again and again,” Michael said, a shiver running down his spine. \n\n“And what is the matter with all that? You committed a crime, it's where you have to go.”\n\n“No, it shouldn't be like that. It isn't fair.”\n\n“You are one to speak of fairness. The stand owner must not think it is fair you took his produce.”\n\n“No, you are correct. I committed a crime. But the degree of punishment has to match the degree of the crime. Proportionality, and so forth. You wouldn't cut off a child's hand for taking a biscuit, would you?”\n\n“No, I wouldn't, I suppose.”\n\n“Right. And this is the same. What you caught me doing was stealing, and for this you sentence me to die? It makes no sense. Heresy, murder, treason, those are all things punishable by death. But not petty theft.” \n\n“And you think being put in the dungeon would be a death sentence? Then what do you suggest I do with you then? Set you loose? No punishment at all is hardly proportional to your crime.”\n\n“Truly, I think having to endure your company has been punishment enough for one day.”\n\n“I don't suppose you would fancy having your hand cut off, would you?”\n\n“No. I absolutely would not like that. So if it's giving you any ideas, please forget them.”\n\nRichard stopped in place. “I just had a terrible idea,” he said, a bit incredulously. \n\n“Eh?”\n\n“Do you happen to have honor of sorts? Just maybe?” \n\n“Huh?”\n\n“Suppose you made a contract with someone. Even you wouldn't break it, would you?”\n\n“No, of course not,” Michael said lying with gusto. \n\n“Hmm. Come this way then,” Richard said, leading them back the other way.\n\n“Alright, so you are letting me go right? I just have to agree to be a better person?”\n\n“Not quite.”\n\n----\n\nThey stood in front of Richard's apartment. Michael looked it over with a discerning eye. I've robbed worse, I guess, he thought. \n\n“What exactly are we doing here?” he asked.\n\n“You are staying here with us,” Richard said with some steel in his voice.\n\n“Us?” Michael asked. Richard responded by walking him into the apartment. \n\n“Oh. Who is she? For that matter, what is your name?”\n\n“She is my sister, Milli,” Richard said, indicating with his head, “and I'm Richard.”\n\n“Charmed, I'm Michael. Nice to meet you both,” he said sarcastically, “so what exactly do you expect of me?”\n\n“I figure a rogue like you must have some good stories of misadventure. Maybe you can entertain her while I try and prepare a meal,” Richard said. \n\n“Er. Alright,” Michael said after a moment. It must be sort of boring having him as a brother, I'll see if I can't make things more interesting around here, he thought. \n\nWhile the evening approached Michael stuck around. He felt ridiculous, he could have easily climbed out a window and disappeared, but he stuck around. He decided when you came down to it, they were decent honest folks, the kind he had little association with. He told all manner of tale, but they definitely had a common flavor. He told of the man with the invisibility ring, who wantonly slept with all the royal princesses. Or of the con artist who convinced a church his donkey was the savior reborn. And the merchant who made his fortune selling rocks with gold paint, but was eventually beheaded by a King's order. Then of the sly fellow who convinced a town he was a dragon living in the nearby cave, simply by projecting his voice, and convinced the town to send forth all their virgins. He would pause patiently to let Milli finish coughing, before resuming his tales. Sadly, her attempts at laughter mostly degraded into coughing, and Michael felt extremely bad about this. \n\nAs the evening went on Michael felt worse and worse, and more attached to Milli. Richard was smug. \n\n“Okay, that's it. We are getting you taken care of,” Michael declared.\n\n“What are you talking about?” Michael asked.\n\n“I'd do whatever I can to hear her laugh without the horrid cough,” he answered, as he pulled out the bag of powder he had acquired. He drew back the draw string and took a whiff of the fragrance. His head swam, and his sinuses burned. Damn, I was never told how you were suppose to take this powder, Michael thought. He had been planning on simply selling the bag at a tidy profit, not actually making any use of it. \n\n“What is that?” \n\n“Oh, I got it from some herbwoman. It's suppose to cure blacklung, except I didn't exactly hear how the patient is suppose to take it. Let's try mixing it into water.” \n\n----\n\nRichard and Michael looked out at the city. It was quiet, all too quiet. \n\n“It's so empty. I feel like we should leave too,” Richard ventured. \n\n“I know what you mean. It makes me uneasy being here, when everyone else is going.”\n\n“Do you think we can risk it?” Richard asked, gesturing at Milli. The medication had worked initially, and she had been better. But after two weeks it ran out, and she relapsed. \n\n“You ought to know. I've been here all my life,” Michael said. \n\n“I'm afraid we can't. The roads would be rough, no doubt. All those people walking down the paved path are probably encouraging bandits too,” Richard mused. \n\n“We had better just wait then, although food is getting to be a problem,” Michael said. With all the merchants gone food was no longer being supplied into the city, so Richard and Michael were forced to scavenge for food in people's abandoned larders.\n\n----\n\nThe night sky seethed with malevolence. The clouds roiled, then boiled off completely. The sky was as dark as a curtained stage, and ghostly lines of green light appeared out of the heavens and descended towards the earth. The lines wormed into the soft earth, and into the slightly decomposed corpses. Then the lines stood taunt, and like so many marionettes the corpses were pulled from the grave. Each corpse was jerked by five lines. Two lines punctured the arms, right at the wrists. Another two pierced the ankles. And the last was wrapped tightly around the heart, and emerged from the corpse's back. The corpses were tugged along in a jerky puppet gait, and thus they exited Dolinsk, like a macabre army in a puppet show. The lines faded into the distance, still dragging their meat puppets with. To where, no one knew, and no one cared follow the promenade of death. \n\n----\n\n“You think it is deep enough?” Michael asked. He and Richard stood on the grounds of a crowded cemetery. The ground was pocked with many shallow graves, dark clumps of overturned dirt, like so many recent scars. In the pit they had dug was Milli. Her skin was pale and lifeless, but she looked serene. \n\n“I don't know. How deep should it be?” Richard wondered out loud.\n\n“Six feet,” Richard and Michael turned to face the speaker, “she needs to be buried six feet deep,” said the cloaked figure. He was short, hardly over five feet, and his cloak all but concealed him. Besides the obvious reasons, he was mysterious. \n\n“And why six feet?” Michael asked.\n\n“So that the puppeteers can't use her. A pretty girl, no? Then keep her body safe,” the stranger answered, in a slightly foreign accent, which sounded as though it had been worn away with practice.\n\n“What are you talking about?” Richard demanded.\n\n“Look around here, how many corpses do you see in the streets? A few days ago there were many. Check these graves. They are empty now. The necromancers are rallying. They've emptied the city of its dead.”\n\n“So what has six feet got to do with it?”\n\n“They can't claim bodies buried that deep. Those are the bounty of the earth, for the earth to reclaim what it once gave up. Those bodies the puppeteers must fight the earth for, and they can't win. The rest though, the sinners and the unburied, they are damned to walk the earth as puppets. No rest for the wicked.”\n\nMichael and Richard looked uneasily at each other. \n\n“To what end?” Michael asked.\n\n“Why do necromancers do what they do? The same reasons anyone does. They seek power, wealth, security,” the stranger spat. \n\n“How do they achieve that?”\n\n“They've gathered their army. The surrounding cities are weak with plague. The cities will all be entirely empty by the time they walk in and help themselves to it. It's a pity only a small force would be required to defend a city.”\n\n“What can be done?” Richard asked. \n\n“You can run,” the stranger replied curtly. \n\n“But you said something about defending the city,” Michael put in. The stranger chuckled. \n\n“That's what I plan on. Each necromancer will bring with him ten or so puppets, but once the puppeteer falls, so do the ten. It's a weakness easily exploited.”\n\n“So what are you planning to do about it?”\n\n“Wait for enforcements,” the figure said as he drew back his hood. He had fine black hair, thin lips, a sharp nose, and a refined chin; he was unmistakably spriggan. \n\nTO BE CONTINUED","updated":{"$date":"2014-02-10T21:57:18.829Z"},"url":"six_feet_deep"}

At one point there was a car beneath where he was sitting. Perhaps there still was, he thought as he looked into the early morning sky. Nearby the windmill stood lazily, its outstretched arms groaning under the weight of clingy leafy vines. Off in the distance the old church stood, robed in ivy. At something pretty close to seven o'clock the church bell intoned deeply, and then the belfry seemed to shudder for an instant before hundreds of disturbed doves exploded out the bell chamber. The birds flew in a spiral of feathers and communal confusion, then settled down just in time for the second ring to redisturb them.\n\nAt the sound of the bell John's son, Mark, approached the windmill from their homestead. John nodded at him, and Mark began his daily chore. Mark tucked the machete he was carrying into his belt and jumped up and grabbed hold of the lowest windmill blade. He pulled himself up by the vines and climbed up, ripping out handfuls of leafs as he went. The windmill creaked uneasily, but did not move its stationary blades. After a while Mark reached the top blade and spent some time looking around. He then went to work with the machete, cutting roots and vines off the vertical blades as he descended. The plant growth came off in big patches, peeling off onto the ground like a second skin. Finally, after Mark had climbed down, did the windmill start to turn lazily in the wind. Now they could have flour. By the next morning, Mark would have to do it all again.","updated":{"$date":"2014-02-10T21:57:18.831Z"},"url":"eden"}

These were lessons of a particularly valuable variety, the kind I had thought I learned but actually hadn't. Thankfully, the great school we call life has an excellent review policy and readily serves up new scenarios to learning a lesson.\n\nSo, some background: my motivation for going to this event was to see a [beautiful flautist](Enchantress) whom I adored.\n\n### Plans are nothing, planning is everything\n\nI had, of course, planned to show up on time. Instead, I arrived late and missed all but the last three minutes of that certain flautist's performance. Clearly I should have planned to have more contingencies surrounding the subway. Alas.\n                                            \nI also didn't check the weather in the afternoon before this excursion. This is a major strategic failing, especially from someone who has read _The Art of War_ three times and should by now understand the importance of weather. Typically I don't mind rain in the slightest and I'm happy to just be rained on. I figure I take showers anyway, and I wash my clothes, so what's the big deal? This particular night I did want to be dry upon arrival, though, so I should have planned ahead and brought rain gear. \n\n### Expectations are worse than nothing\n\nI've gotten decent at freeing myself from expectations. But tonight my emotions got the better of me, and I created all sorts of elaborate expectations for the night. These were summarily shattered as I listened to the (amazing) last three minutes of Mozart's _Flute and Harp Concerto K. 299_ through the lobby speakers. This I felt as a massive wave of disappointment at unmet expectations. Very silly. Fortunately, I was cognizant enough to recognize the disappointment for what it was, replace it with disappointment in my inability to avoid disappointment, and then replace that with a restored sense of neutrality and openness to experience.\n\nStill, better to just avoid the feeling of disappointment entirely by releasing all expectations. I've found this allows me to embrace every moment of life for exactly what it is, which is the way I want to live.\n\n### Pure experience is so worth living for\n\nThankfully I was able to pull myself together midway through the fifth movement of Dvořák's _Dumky Trio, Op. 90_ and actually _listen to the music_. What a novel concept. It took a long time to clear my head. Infatuation is probably the most challenging emotion/thought I've faced in my meditation. It ranks above even old bogeys fear, pain, depression and such because it is so darn pleasant I almost don't want to clear it away.\n\nFinally, finally there was silence in my head, and I could fully hear the music. And how exquisite it was. When my mind is totally empty I have what I can only describe as an _experience_. It's totally beyond my capacity to explain in words. It's as if I am seeing clearly for the first time. Everything looks just so vivid, so detailed. There is so much depth and beauty to objects. Sounds are crisp and deep and broad and totally filling. Every texture and smell and feeling is just so immediate and overwhelming. The best way I can describe it is that it is like being a child again, taking delight in the simplest of experiences. There is no jadedness, and nothing is filtered by words. When I'm in this state I am not eating _a burger_. I'm eating _the burger_ and intimately experiencing all the peculiarities of that particular patty, that particular bun, the specific arrangement of toppings and condiments, the oozing melty goodness that is the cheese. I'm not having the experience I've had hundreds of times of “eating a burger”. I’m having the once in a lifetime experience of “eating _that_ burger”, but of course, the experience itself goes above and beyond words. In fact, it is not possible until I cease to use words. Words are like a filter that stand between us and the pureness of experience. \n\nThe rest of the concert was pure bliss. There’s so much richness to live music. I really love it. Not that I don’t enjoy recorded music, but the sound is just so alive and thick and immersing when it is live. And you get to see the performers pouring their souls out into their music. I’ve always loved Rachmaninoff, so I was delighted to hear his _Cello Sonata in G Minor, Op. 19_. I hadn’t heard much Dvořák before this evening, but I must say, I quite like him. I greatly enjoyed this fantastic piece called _Shu_ by Somei Satoh, that was apparently composed in 2004. I don’t get to listen to a lot of modern classical music, and it was very interesting. I don’t think I’d ever heard a vibraphone live before that.\n\n### Follow the heart\n\nAfter the concert I had a brief opportunity to speak to aforementioned flautist, which I missed because I _didn’t want to look like a fool_ and run after her. Silly me, ignoring my own [advice](be_a_fool). Note to self, always run after women, they can disappear like ninjas.\n\nAll in all, despite ostensibly “failing” this was a wonderful day. I was expecting to pay $20 for my ticket at Carnegie Hall, but it ended up being free, so I gave it to this excellent street performer in the subway who was really rocking the voice + keyboard combo. By the time I got home my spirits were up again, I walked slowly in the rain and enjoyed it, was able to laugh at myself, ready to write about what I’d experienced and reflect. I’m cautiously optimistic about the progress I’ve made. Two years ago an experience like showing up late might have had me moping for a few days, if not a week.

For example, for the sins I have committed in this life, perhaps I shall be reborn as a cockroach.\n\nI have no way of knowing whether that naive literal interpretation is true or not. But I will explain how a more nuanced interpretation can make perfect sense.\n\nMy interpretation of it is as follows: since all phenomena I have ever observed are impermanent, then from each moment to moment I am, in fact, a different person than I was before; thus I am ‘reborn’ each moment as an entirely new person; I can affect who I will be reborn as through my karma (literally means ‘action’ in Sanskrit) as each action I take obviously changes my state in the next moment.\n\nThis teaching flows quite naturally from the one evident truth and the one essential dogma of [Min Buddhism](min_buddhism). In my interpretation, the concepts of “hell” and “heaven” realms of traditional Buddhist doctrines are metaphors for psychological states. As poignantly illustrated by _Crime \u0026 Punishment_ when one commits murder, then one is reborn into the hell realm of murderers. Not a comfortable place to be. But you may find that if you perform good works, then you are increasingly reborn into heaven realms, and you are increasingly surrounded by beautiful people not unlike angels.\n\nThe time for your rebirth is now, and the choice is yours, where will you be reborn?","updated":{"$date":"2013-11-21T21:37:44.224Z"},"url":"reincarnation_in_min_buddhism"}

They called it _Amtssprache_, loosely translated into English as \"office talk\" or \"bureaucratese.\" For example, if asked why they took a certain actions, the rsponse would be, \"I had to.\" If asked why they \"had to,\" the answer would be, \"Superiors' orders.\" \"Company policy.\" \"It was law.\"\n\nWe deny responsibility for ours actions by attributing their causes to outside forces:\n\n- vague, impersonal forces: \"I emptied the litter because I had to.\"\n- our condition, diagnosis, or personal or psychological history: \"I smoke because I have an addictive personality.\"\n- actions of others: \"I hit him because he was being noisy.\"\n- authority: \"I lied because my boss told me to.\"\n- peer pressure: \"I started smoking because my friends did.\"\n- institutional policy: \"I have to fail you because it's the school's policy.\"\n- societal roles: \"I hate going to work, but I do it because I am a husband and a father.\"\n- uncontrollable impulses: \"I was overcome by my urge to masturbate.\"\n\n\u003e We can replace language that implies lack of choice with language that acknowledges choice.\n\n\u003e We are dangerous when we are not conscious of our responsibility for how we behave, think, and feel.\n\n4. Stating desires as demands.\n\n\u003e We can never make people do anything.\n\n\u003e Thinking based on \"who deserves what\" blocks compassionate communication.\n\n","updated":{"$date":"2013-11-29T17:19:16.538Z"},"url":"non_violent_communication"}

I think I just have to modify the procedure to make it a little easier for myself.\n\n#### Exercise?\n\nStarted doing pull-ups using just one arm on each side, it's much harder this way. Hopefully I can get to the point of doing a true one armed pull-up eventually.\n\n#### Taijutsu? \n\nMade a breakthrough today. It seems like I can do all the forms much more correctly if I focus on Dr. Morris's tip that \"God loves an upright man. The key thing that I must do is keep my spine straight while working on everything else I have to do. It seems to be helping my kamae and tsuki. \n\nDaria helped me practice omote gyaku and I had her increase resistance and then I wasn't able to affect her as well, so that was good. Means I still have a lot of work to do on it. But I have been making solid improvements in it.\n\nMajor breakthrough now, a bit later. So the arm goes up when you go into ko-ichimonji because it is acting as a counter balance that allows you to stop when you get to the center. That's the secret to all of the crisp snapping into place that my teachers are able to do, they can do it because they stop it with a counter balance. The key and feeling to taijutsu is to always be in balance, thus the limbs go where they go in order to maintain balance, and the strikes and everything become very natural. In order to remain balanced when dropping low, the arm shoots up.\n\n#### Journal? \n\nDoing that right now.\n\nFeeling a little bit existentially lost right now. I'm really interested in getting involved with space exploration companies, but it doesn't seem like I have the skills necessary yet. Another way of looking at it is that they aren't operating at a scale where they need a lot of software engineers above the systems level yet. Once there are a lot more competing space companies I'm sure it will reach that point. \n","updated":{"$date":"2013-12-05T19:53:45.340Z"},"url":"11_30_2013"}

,{"_id":"Sa5wa5zP5SDZJmdGE","active":true,"name":"0","prose":"XPMotnSi2fmqYRnrW","text":"#### Do you ever feel really high? Can you describe it?\n\nYes, when I meditate I can enter Jhana states of bliss. Words can't describe this, as you must seek the experience yourself. I will attempt to approximate. It is as if my entire body--every cell--is suffused with light. There is deep joy and peace within my heart and I feel my entire being in harmony. The imagined boundary between myself and the universe is dissolved and at once I understand that everything is connected, just as both modern physics and ancient tradition tell us.\n\n#### Do you ever feel really low? Can you describe it?\n\nIn the past I did. I was once afflicted with depression and short attention span. I had trapped myself in a prison of my own negative thoughts. Unable to break out of that reality I had built I spent days languishing in bed, addicted to pornography, abusing drugs. I hated myself and could not find pleasure in any activity. I no longer feel \"low\" as people would describe it. How? I am not my thoughts, I am not my emotions. Both I manipulate as I will. If I were to feel low, it would be for the sake of playacting.\n\n#### Do you ever have several feelings at once? Can you describe them?\n\nCertainly. My baseline feelings are the following: relaxed calm, confidence in my abilities, happiness, love, and ecstasy. I learned to maintain this state through a practice known as the Secret Smile, and I am happy to teach it to anyone.\n\n#### How are you affected by the feelings of people around you?\n\nThere was a time when I was greatly affected. Now that I am in control of emotion, I choose to respond to the feelings of people around me in whichever manner I believe best fulfills my guiding principles. \n\n#### Which of your own feelings affect you most strongly and how?\n\nNone. My feelings can't affect the infinitesimal spark of consciousness that is my true existence. Rather it is I who affect feelings. \n\n#### Have you ever formed a strong attachment to a place, a pet or a person? If so could you describe it?\n\nIn the past, certainly. I have loved my homes and loved my friends. Now I do not remain attached for all phenomena are impermanent. When Daria is present I appreciate every moment with her. When Daria is gone I appreciate every moment without her.\n\n#### How do your friendships develop?\n\nPeople often wish to be my friend. If that is the case I allow it to develop. If someone is in need of a friend I approach. If a group would benefit from my perspective, first I adapt myself to the group, then after I have melded with the group I slowly reveal unexpected facets so that they are exposed to new ideas.\n\n#### What situations bring you into conflict with others?\n\nOne of my guiding principles is \"Minimize Interference\". Thus I never bring myself into conflict with others. This question is poorly worded, as situations never bring a person into conflict, that person brings him or herself into conflict. I would intervene on behalf of the weaker party if I saw an asymmetrical attack.\n\n#### What makes you most afraid or anxious?\n\nThings do not make you afraid or anxious, you make yourself afraid or anxious by your response to the thing. Should I choose to make myself afraid or anxious it would be over the great confusion of people and plight of the poor.\n\n#### Do you ever think of death?\n\nContinually. I live the true Buddhist doctrine of reincarnation, which is to die in every moment and be reborn a better person. \n\n#### If you ask yourself, “Who am I really?” what is the answer?\n\nEverything and nothing.\n\n#### How well do you like being all by yourself?\n\nPerfectly well. As a zentrovert I choose to appreciate introversion when there is no one, and extroversion when there is someone.\n\n#### How well do you like being watched and admired?\n\nPerfectly well.\n\n#### What kinds of things give you the most pleasure? When you experience pleasure, with what sense, or senses, do you feel it the most? (Give specific examples).\n\nMeditation as it allows me to give myself pleasure to whatever degree I can stand.\n\n#### Seeing (kinds of colors, clothes, face, bodies, hair, etc.)\n\nAll sights are beautiful and to be appreciated in the moment.\n\n#### Tasting (kinds of foods, drinks, sweets, spices, etc.)\n\nAll tastes are beautiful and to be appreciated in the moment.\n\n#### Smelling (perfume, smoke, bodies, hair, etc.)\n\nAll smells are beautiful and to be appreciated in the moment.\n\n#### Touching (fur, hair, hands, cheeks, lips, etc.)\n\nAll textures are beautiful and to be appreciated in the moment.\n\n#### Hearing (songs, voices, birds, wind, etc.)\n\nAll sounds are beautiful and to be appreciated in the moment.\n\n#### What kinds of things disgust you? (Give specific examples)\n\n#### Seeing\n\nFollowing the Tantric path I have confronted that which did disgust me until I learned the arbitrariness of all my reactions. Since I determine my own reactions to all that I experience, I have decided my reaction will be that of love and appreciation. All sights are beautiful and to be appreciated in the moment.\n\n#### Tasting\n\nAll tastes are beautiful and to be appreciated in the moment.\n\n#### Smelling\n\nAll smells are beautiful and to be appreciated in the moment.\n\n#### Touching\n\nAll textures are beautiful and to be appreciated in the moment.\n\n#### Hearing\n\nAll sounds are beautiful and to be appreciated in the moment.\n\n#### Do you ever indulge in daydreams or fantasies? If so what is your special kind?\n\nYes. That governments will operate from the bottom-up, driven by informed and self-sufficient citizens living and working together in cooperative corporations for mutual benefit. That all basic necessities will be provided for anyone born on this planet, so that people are freed to pursue creativity and their true will. That Thelema will taught across the globe. That billions shall be enlightened, or at least that meditation is taught instead of detention in compulsory schooling.\n\n#### What kind of dreams to you have and how often?\n\nLucid dreams every evening, which I use to think creatively, get extra practice in my skills, and explore my subconscious. \n\n#### How well can you picture or “see” events that occurred in your life or someone else’s life, and events that are still in the future? Could you give examples?\n\nI can visualize events in my own life with clarity. Everything that is possible to imagine has happened and will happen, what use is glimpsing an arbitrary slice of that except to write 'fiction'?\n\n#### Do you ever catch yourself seeing or imagining things? Could you give examples?\n\nI do not catch myself doing it, as I do it as I will it. I imagine things that I wish to occur as a way of organizing my concrete approach towards making them manifest.\n\n#### Does it ever appear that the things around you may have a life of their own and that plants, animals and all things in nature have their own thoughts and feelings? Could you give examples.\n\nIf I choose to see the world through that reality tunnel then everything has an animating spirit. That is just one perspective out of many with which to view the world.\n\n#### Are you poetically inclined? If so, could you give an example of what comes to mind in a poetic mood?\n\nDefine inclined. I compose poetry, usually when love is on my mind.\n\n#### What kind of things gets your mind going?\n\nAgain, things do not get the mind going. The mind gets itself going. If I choose to stir it up, then it stirs.\n\n#### What do you like to concentrate on the most?\n\nAttaining mushin through meditation.\n\n#### In what manner does the unknown become known to you, i.e., in what manner do you grasp new ideas and concepts?\n\nThrough direct observation and inspiration.\n\n#### Do you ever observe and analyze yourself?\n\nOf course.\n\n#### Do you ever think about your own thinking?\n\nOf course.\n\n#### Do you ever carry on arguments in your own head? Could you explain what they are all about?\n\nYes. The mind is not one mind but many. The representatives of various interests will argue and confer over which actions to undertake, after which I make a decision.\n\n#### In what manner do you observe and analyze others?\n\nObservation and analysis or judgment are separate. It is essential to observe with complete openness. After that, mental models are revised with the new data.\n\n#### Do you ever feel sharply critical?\n\nIf I choose to, yes. I choose to turn the dagger of analysis inward.\n\n#### When you read a book what attracts your attention the most?\n\nProcesses I can apply to my life, or allegories for spiritual attainment.\n\n#### When do you feel the most energy? How do you discharge it?\n\nWhen I perform qi gong meditations and draw energy into myself. If I don't discharge it through healing or other effects, then I either store the energy in my hara for later use, or I ground it in the earth.\n\n#### ON what occasions do you find yourself chattering or talking incessantly?\n\nI don't. One of my guiding principles is \"minimize noise\".\n\n#### What kind of play, games or practical jokes do you engage in?\n\nFollowing in Robert Anton Wilson's footsteps I enjoy engaging in ontological guerrilla warfare. \n\n#### What kind of physical activity (or inactivity) gives you the most satisfaction?\n\nI practice Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu.\n\n#### When do you feel the greatest urge to do something?\n\nRight before I do it.\n\n#### Do you ever act on impulse?\n\nI create impulses through which actions occur.\n\n#### Do you have any nervous habits? Give specific examples.\n\nNo, I have eliminated these.","updated":{"$date":"2013-12-01T07:17:06.310Z"},"url":"study_questionnaire"}

,{"_id":"TdJ7N8mgv2tW8BS9Z","active":true,"name":"7","prose":"cTNsZDZcqXM9zSo9j","text":"Jealousy makes me feel weak and cowardly.\n\nI love [Daria](http://dariajung.com/) very much. More than I knew I could love someone. And if she loved another man, then I would love that man too. As a [lover](lovism), that's simply the right thing to do. Personally, I can think of few things more joyous than celebrating a loved one's love. Anyone someone I love loves, is a friend of mine.\n\nTo be jealous of your lover's lover is the height of selfishness. No true lover would be so little as to destroy another love. If I were jealous it would mean I wasn't brave enough to love, making me a coward. If I were jealous it would mean I wasn't strong enough to love, making me a weakling.\n\nIt would also mean I'm a freaking moron. If Daria loves someone, that is a strong endorsement of their character. One of the strongest endorsements anyone can receive is being loved by someone I love. Outside of the people I love, the people I want to help most are those loved by the people I love. Isn't this just the most obvious implication of the meaning of love?\n\nI grew up in a culture that tends to portray jealousy as going along with love. \"If the person you love is worth it, and they love someone else, then you'll be jealous,\" it told me. I disagree. Jealousy feels like anti-love to me. If the person you love is worth it, then it's worth not being jealous. It's worth breaking out into song and dance with exuberance that they have found yet more love!\n\nLove is not a pie. Just because I love Daria a lot, doesn't mean there is any less love to go around. Rather, love is like a fission reaction. You kindle a love here, and soon it starts a chain reaction. Don't extinguish a beautiful cascade of love through a selfish implosion.\n\nLove is sometimes analogized to chemistry, as in, 'the nuclear family'. I like this analogy, but I think most people don't take its implications far enough. I think we should encourage the formation of higher order molecules.  Most 'nuclear family' relationships are like H\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e, one atom bound to another atom, both accepting only one bond. Maybe most people are H, so naturally most relationships are H\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e. But that doesn't mean we should stop the formation of other beautiful structures like H\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003eO, CH\u003csub\u003e4\u003c/sub\u003e or even massive animo acid chains comprised of families linked together by love between their members.","title":"Jealousy makes me feel weak and cowardly","updated":{"$date":"2013-12-02T23:02:23.855Z"},"url":"jealousy_makes_me_feel_weak_and_cowardly"}

I realized that for confidence in abilities I should remember the feeling after I give Daria an orgasm. Which also then leads very nicely into remembering the feeling before my own orgasm. So that dovetails very nicely.\n\n#### Exercise?\n\nMore of these one arm pull-ups. I feel that I will be very strong after a while. In terms of exercising my eyes I was doing tracing and noticing some great improvements in my vision.\n\n#### Taijutsu?\n\nDonovan showed up and gave Anthony and I tips on [san shin](san_shin) and then we practiced [sui no kata](sui_no_kata) and [ka no kata](ka_no_kata). Then we switched to doing omote gyaku, and I think we made some good progress with it. It's important to have flow during the technique for it to work, because the opponent has to stay off balance. When turning into ko-ichimonji it's important to bring their arm up and drop and turn and match elbows all at once, and then it works.\n\n#### Journal?\n\nDreamed I was meant to take a flight to somewhere, but I left in a hurry and forgot a lot of stuff I needed like my passport. I was driven there by Matt Guindin from work, and as soon I we got to the airport he coincidentally picked up two of his friends from the airport. The airport was really futuristic, you took trains to all the actual air terminals And apparently I was completely late for my flight in any case, but I couldn't get through security. I got a phone call from the airline and was told that Shaun helped me out by rescheduling my flights, and then picking me up from the airport. I guess he was slated to arrive at my house that day and had read my papers and figured out what was happening and realized I was already late. Somehow Daria appeared at the airport with me after I discovered that Shaun had rescheduled my flight. I had a lot of problems trying to text in my dream, but I was able to do it. Shaun sent me a text saying that he basically was capable of ruining anything with his attitude, which made me happy because it was the first time he had acknowledged that. After that, we went to this terrible pizza place that was going out of business because it was super old. Josh joined us there somehow. He launched into some technical argument about how the mist being generated in the restaurant to go along with music and light show was technically solid instead of liquid. Then the owner came and argued with him. Then the owner gave us a discount on all the food, and Daria was embarrassed. The owner kept doing really weird stuff like blowing on our pizza and meatloaf. It was not a great dining experience, but I tried to sympathize with him over the fact that his business was going under and he couldn't get a loan in the current credit climate. \n\nAnyway, I'm sitting at work right now, and it kind of feels like I'm wasting my time, but I do have things that I should do, so I should get to them. It's just that as soon as I got here Melissa has started wasting my time with random low priority issues, so I don't really get what the hell is going on. I guess she doesn't know that I have more interesting work to do? Seriously, I don't know what I'm doing here right now. Also, it's a pain in the ass to have to install Murmurhash on PHP, it's annoying that it's not built in.

I'm curious to see how my one on one is going to go. I'm definitely going to devote myself to esoteric martial arts, I have decided.\n\nOkay, stupid me. I have to work on an autosaver for this because I just lost several paragraphs that I wrote. However, I will rewrite them.\n\nI saw first hand today how shaky memory can be, which my dad had often told me about regarding witness testimony. I thought that I had watched Spirited Away with Daria and she insisted that we hadn't, which upset her because I was convinced that I had. But I think I actually watched it with Priscilla. What confused me was that I watched it with a female that I loved, so I guess I got the two of them mixed up in my head at the time. In any case, I will confirm with Priscilla when I see her soon. \n\nIn other news, the hoshin jutaijutsu books that I ordered have not disappointed. In fact they have far exceeded my expectations. Today I felt and saw my aura. It's still fairly small, only an inch or so, which is above average because I have been meditating, but clearly I don't know how to generate energy yet. I think that I will study taijutsu under Josh while studying hoshin too, because I think understanding hoshin and generating energy is really going to help me out in taijutsu. It clearly was meant to be used, but it doesn't seem to be taught much anymore as most people aren't learning the ura or hidden side of the art. \n\nToday's one on one with Melissa went very well I feel. I think that this idea of non violent communication is very useful, and it seems that if I am just honest about my needs they will be met. I hope that I can get the same results with Daria, but sometimes I have doubts. \n\nA great example of nonviolent communication would be the following:\n\n\"You are so patronizing.\" -\u003e \"When you said 'hallucinate' it made me feel patronized.\"\n\nThat way the observation is separated from the evaluation. I felt a bit hurt when Daria called me patronizing, although I can understand where that is coming from. I think I am patronizing her, literally, and that kind of hurts me because I don't always feel appreciated for that, and frankly I don't want to be patronizing her.","title":"Tue Dec 03 2013","updated":{"$date":"2013-12-05T19:52:57.375Z"},"url":"12_3_2013"}

A hash algorithm that returns an integer would be most convenient for this.\n\nJust thought of a new feature for the blog. For these journal entries I'm writing throughout the day and it isn't always clear when I'm writing, so I would like a keyboard shortcut that just inserts the time of the day into the buffer at the cursor position.

Then somehow I saw three guys hitting on this one girl who is very pretty too. Daria and I intervene and we make fun of the guys, and the girl comes with us. Then we go to the foodcourt of the hotel and Daria and the girl eat. I'm sitting next to the girl and I tell her that we are dreaming, and once she knows that she can wake up and start experimenting. Across from me sitting next to Daria is apparently Brandon, who says something I don't remember, but I tell him \"Holy shit you must have gotten so smart by writing down everything you said that was smart\", which is why I'm writing this down. The girl leaves, but I text her all this information about this reality. I also facebook message her. The facebook messenger screen has all this weird information about how you have to verify a \"waif's age\" because they might be under 18 and all these other ominous warnings about having sex with her. She's trying to convince a senator of something, and I tell her that the senator's son was paralyzed because his spine was broken during a car accident. \n\nRecursion is so key to understanding existence. If a programmer does not understand recursion I would hesitate to deem him a programmer at all.\n\nHopefully I can help Daria follow through on more of her resolutions, like that she wants to do a MIT lecture every day or use one of those workout videos everyday.  \n\nOverall today was a decent day. I really enjoyed the quantum mechanics thing. I wasted a lot of time today being in meetings, but I wanted to be there for jordan and plus it was good to get some ice cream. I'm a little sad that I keep having to deal with Netsuite, and I hope we can get these current issues resolved, because it is really quite silly that we can't, but whatever. I think I should be able to figure out a way around these problems eventually. It's really weird that whatever other thing we have integrated with netsuite is overwriting our data. That is really rude.\n\nAnyway, today as I was about to come I channeled the energy into creating two servitors, one for each eye, that are going to help me dramatically improve my vision by the time I go to Palantir. That is going to be really awesome. Their sigil is very simple, just a sideways eight with a line through the middle that splits off at the end. I expect that they shall work very quickly and that I will be very happy with the results. Provided they do as I task them, I shall keep them alive for a long time and upgrade them and feed them further energy and give them sentience. That will be their reward.

This will be especially nice because I often, like right now, journal at weird times of the day, and this will help me keep track of that. So I'm really happy about this.\n\n12:34:00 AM: I anticipate being able to do a ton of refactoring, because underscore is really powerful and there are totally things I could rewrite now that I know I have underscore. Also I can start making things more object oriented.\n\n2:43:23 PM: Ugh, seems like I really should figure out a way to change the way the index page displays because sometimes it can take a really long time to load and it doesn't display anything while the subscriptions are loading. Maybe I can make that wait() the initial subscriptions, but the way javascript scoping works is a bit un-ideal. But I suppose what I could do is in the Router pass 'this' to the setRouteSubscriptions method so that way I could use the wait() methods on those subscriptions. I think it's worth considering.\n\n2:46:21 PM: I'm not sure how I feel about the way revisions are done right now, I think perhaps it should be easier to save new revisions because right now I'm basically just always saving over the current revision.\n\n2:46:55 PM: I think I might implement AVL and Red Black trees in Ruby, since those seem to be a weakness of mine right now.\n\n2:49:27 PM: I think I want to save view information in mongo so that it persists and so that every wiki page has its own viewport state, which would fix the annoyances with the current process. But I could also just store which prose has the viewport information and invalidate it when the prose switches. That might be the easiest solution right now.\n\n3:26:00 PM: I'm curious about how scheduling algorithms like those used in the Linux kernel could be applied to actual life. I don't see much reason why I shouldn't take advantage of algorithms for scheduling tasks that all have to get done in my own life. It certainly seems like my computers are better at scheduling than I am, and it's just because they are using algorithms and I'm not. Of course, their tasks are a little better defined than mine, but I think that must be part of the point of Getting Things Done is figuring out exactly what the tasks are so that they can be scheduled like that.\n\n3:29:33 PM: To a certain extent the analogy of a brain with a computer is vacuous, but on the other hand, it can be an extremely useful analogy. I think that it is worthwhile for me to dive deep into computer science as a way of debugging and optimizing my thought process using novel algorithms. I will investigate scheduling algorithms.\n\n#### Meditate?\n\nI think that I will continue refining the secret smile meditation until that is basically second nature to me. And I should continue practicing mushin of course, and see if I can get better and better at directing energy.\n\n#### Exercise?\n\nDid one pullup and two one armed pullups on either side.\n\n#### Taijutsu?\n\nI should make sure to practice taijutsu today since I didn't yesterday.\n\nGoing to practice [tsuki](tsuki) today with an emphasis on keeping my butt in and my spine straight, and not stepping so far that I can't do [hicho](hicho_no_kamae) from where I stop.\n\n6:06:11 PM: Okay, tsuki is pretty hard. Also, starting to feel the qi while doing taijutsu, which I think is a great sign. I think kamae and everything we do will make so much more sense once I can feel the qi, which is why hoshin emphasizes developing a lot of qi so that the body can move with it.\n\n6:09:54 PM: For leg workouts I suppose I shall just practice lots of hicho. I should be able to stand in it for like fifteen minutes without losing my balance. That is a great posture for training strength and balance, which I think are actually one and the same. It is crazy how exhausting just a little taijutsu every day is. Hopefully Dr. Morris and the Bujin will guide me towards enlightenment. \n\n#### Journal?\n\n12:01:33 PM: I have decided that it is my true will that Melissa get an opportunity so great that she resigns from Sailthru to pursue it, as a result Matt G is made team lead, and my compensation also increases because I am able to negotiate for it using my offer from Palantir.\n\n11:10:29 PM: Well, that church of subgenius video was certainly strange, but it did give me a lot of new ideas. Suffice it to say I will not be joining the church of subgenius, because to do so would be highly idiotic. The point is obviously to illustrate that anyone can create a religion regardless of how funny it might seem (Scientology, Mormonism, etc.) and people will follow. The people being anyone who isn't a subgenius. \n\n11:17:14 PM: I decided as a Yin person doing the secret smile from the top down makes more sense for me, and the progression that way makes more sense too. Laughter -\u003e Love -\u003e Confidence in sexual abilities as she comes -\u003e ecstasy as I am on the verge -\u003e to total relaxation in the aftermath.\n\n11:37:44 PM: Okay, so that didn't take too long for me to implement autosaving, which is pretty cool. And in a bit of \"it's a feature not a bug!\" the scrollbar flashes whenever an autosave occurs, which is actually kind of nifty in a strange way. I'm really digging the hoshin book. Also I'm so glad that Daria when to sleep earlier tonight, because she has really been having a lot of restless nights lately and frankly has a lot of sleep to catch up on, so I'm glad that she conked out, even if it means we didn't have sex tonight.

Your body should form a single line to the enemy, presenting as little surface for attack at possible. This allows you to defend yourself by controlling the [center](taijutsu_center). Striking along a line also provides power, as your force travels along a single vector.\n- Like walking, many taijutsu techniques are controlled falls. [Uke](taijutsu_uke) is a great example of this, as is [tsuki](taijutsu_tsuki). It maybe psychologically beneficial to begin training with [ukemi](taijutsu_ukemi) so you are comfortable with the idea of working with gravity. Much of the force in movements like tsuki is generated by gravity, which is then transferred through a pivot (your back foot) into your opponent's body. During that movement it is as if your body is falling forward along the line towards your opponent. When practicing solo, your front foot eventually catches you, preventing your from actually hitting the ground. In a real situation, you are stopped when you impact your opponent and transfer your momentum to him.\n- Generally speaking, keep your shoulders down. This connects them to your body. In most strikes and grapples the arms are not generating much force, they are simply firmly connected to the body while the body generates the movement.\n- Also keep your elbows close to your torso. Keeping your elbows out is an invitation to your opponent to put you in [ura gyaku](ura_gyaku) or [omote gyaku](omote_gyaku) and it also weakens your arms.\n- Pay attention to timing and distancing. \n- Most techniques rest on being able to do the basic kamae and movements correctly. Almost all techniques share the same footwork, and in fact, a master like [Kacem Zoughari](http://www.benevolentheart.com/martial/about.html#tabs-4) can demonstrate the interchangeability of the footwork depending on circumstances.

She has grown a lot in the past few years and I'm really proud of her for it.\n\n12:31:11 AM: It's too bad that Anton hasn't replied, but I will do my best to study energy and awaken my kundalini on my own.

It's ambiguous from his email.\n\n1:11:41 AM: Just finished the Hoshinjutsu book. I think that I will devote myself to the KAP, I'm currently downloading the manuals.

I tried to explore the housing and noticed the floors were during goopy so I guess I decided it was a dream. There was a girl and a guy in our room at the house with us. The house was in bad condition, and there was mysteriously another section to it that looked like a different apartment that I couldn't get to because the floor was drooping. That was when I realized I was in a dream, and I bounced on the goopy floor. Then the first thought as I had upon realizing I was in a dream and thinking about what I wanted to do was have sex with Daria, so I went over to where she was in the room. I got distracted along the way by talking to a guy. I pulled out a bunch of magnetic needles from the ground which were facing up and seemingly very dangerous. The people in our room were apparently Daria's friends? One of the girls started touching my penis with her foot which weirded me out so I went into kamae, and then we started mock fighting, it was very strange. Later Daria and I escaped outside. Daria and I had sex which caused me to ejaculate very quickly, seemingly in public which was strange. Then we ended up inside another apartment which big bay windows and it was dark out. I was seeing her aura which was deep blue against a black background, so it may be light blue. A buddhist monk/statue thing was talking to me about a television program he was watching about the dalai lama about how important it is that the staff only has one bell and not thousands. \n\n1:44:27 PM: It seems like to win in the modern business climate I will have to become a sociopath by choice. At least I can be a good sociopath. The techniques of a sociopath, like any other technology, are neither inherently good or bad.\n\n4:00:49 PM: I'm going to log off of IRC for a while and finish my reading, and then I think we have to finish mapping out ths psyche and elect a leader and figure out how to do fair scheduling.\n\n8:41:16 PM: I hope Daria makes it home okay. I have been magnificently unproductive today, but I guess that's what happens when I stay home and I don't make a plan for what I'm going to do.

That was a little more just talking about Soke Williams' personal experiences and it seemed a bit less about actual techniques. But it was still interesting.

In the dream the last time I had saw him was at a soccer team reunion party, and I had already started working in New York at that time. We talked about how great of a dealer Pete was. Daria was hanging out with us and we were waiting for Andy. Luke was playing some weird music and Daria asked if she could DJ and he said something to the effect of go ahead. I guess we were in \"my room\" in \"Saddlewood\". We somehow started to talk about the occult, at which point Luke summoned a little demon to visible manifestation, which began to molest Daria. I hit him and it disappeared. Then he summoned this evil cat thing that was made up of lots of dark wisps which would try to attack us, was extremely hard to fight and very fast. Finally I managed to whip it to death. Daria was very scared and I tried to cast a circle of protection around her from a really big tome. When I tried to remove the evil cat's corpse I found a pile of rotting meat in one of my shelves that had turned into lots of maggots and flies. At this point I was disgusted and the dream changed. I was in a multi level shopping mall, probably the mall of America and I went from a big bookstore to the Lego store. They were selling little kits of mini figures plus a few props for a lot of money. Like a ninja mini figure with shuriken and a wizard mini figure. \n\n12:42:58 AM: Decided that I am going to journal before doing the KAP meditation, since I've been noticing a lot of day dreaming during the process. Of course, my body is still going through the steps of the meditation, but I believe I will get better results if I apply a meditative focus to the process. Plane ride was interesting, I wasn't able to finish the KAP meditation while I was in the air due to the weirdness of it and all the distracting thoughts that it brought up. Oh, let me go and cast yijing for tomorrow.\n\n6. Sung / Conflict -\u003e 44. Kou / Coming to Meet\n\nOkay. Wow, this might be the most directly applicable draw I've ever had.\n\n\u003e  CONFLICT. You are sincere\n\u0009And are being obstructed.\n\u0009A cautious halt halfway brings good fortune.\n\u0009Going through to the end brings misfortune.\n\u0009It furthers one to see the great man.\n\u0009It does not further one to cross the great water.\n\nI'm not sure who the \"great man\" here refers to, but it says \"It is important to see the great man, that is, an impartial man whose authority is great enough to terminate the conflict amicably or assure a just decision.\" I think that might be Brian May in this case. Maybe if I come clean and be honest with him then I can make this okay.\n\n\"In times of strife, crossing the great water is to be avoided, that \nis, dangerous enterprises are not to be begun, because in order to be successful \nthey require concerted unity of focus. Conflict within weakens the power to \nconquer danger without.\"\n\nI absolutely can not take the job at Palantir because of this.\n\n\u0009Six in the third place means:\n\u0009To nourish oneself on ancient virtue induces perseverance.\n\u0009Danger. In the end, good fortune comes.\n\u0009If by chance you are in the service of a king,\n\u0009Seek not works.\n\nThis is a warning of the danger that goes with an expansive disposition. Only \nthat which has been honestly acquired through merit remains a permanent \npossession. It can happen that such a possession may be contested, but since it \nis really one's own, one cannot be robbed of it. Whatever a man possesses \nthrough the strength of his own nature cannot be lost. If one enters the \nservice of a superior, one can avoid conflict only by not seeking works for the \nsake of prestige. It is enough if the work is done: let the honor go to the \nother.\n\nPerhaps I should just bide my time and let this whole matter fall away. I shouldn't even try to use this as leverage for a raise, and just be satisfied with the raise they give me at the end of the year.\n\nI don't know how to interpret Coming to Meet. Perhaps it is a warning about Maya. I feel that I am in peril here, so I much watch my step carefully.\n\n1:47:20 AM: Still a lot of mind wandering today. Maybe I should seriously pursue the idea of getting Talmadge to remaster that tape. But I have to first apologize to him for stealing his merchandise, repay him in full, and write him some glowing testimonials, seeing as how his stuff really works. In particular the pheromone protocol has been amazing. I was really hot and sweating by the end, however. Also I feel a lot less affected by the alcohol which is interesting.","title":"Wed Dec 11 2013","updated":{"$date":"2013-12-12T16:11:36.458Z"},"url":"12_11_2013"}

I think that I will find it an overall improvement. I think that I will do one of those leaving page confirmations, and also save the page when a person attempts to leave. That way I will avoid instances where I have forgotten to save my work.\n\n#### Meditate?\n\nDid KAP last night, and started the day off with it today. Interestingly I think I found the tensing we do at the beginning of KAP felt similar to the power lock exercise in Mantak Chia's book.\n\n#### Exercise?\n\nI have not exercised consistently recently. While I stayed in Minnesota I exercised by playing various fun games with Priscilla and Daria such as carrying both of them on my back. Once I even carried both of them on my back at once.\n\n9:34:14 AM: Two one-side pullups on both arms.\n\n10:10:45 PM: One OSPU on both arms.\n\n12:47:39 PM: Carried heavy bag of groceries home from TJ's.\n\n12:23:24 AM: One twenty minute yoga session and then sexercise.\n\n#### Taijutsu?\n\nExcept doing demonstrations for Andy, Levi, and Kevin Martin and Priscilla I haven't really practiced taijutsu much.

In fact, I expect that I will journal once per day. I wish that I had journaled more while I stayed in Minnesota, because I had interesting dreams there and I had interesting experiences. But I do not regret anything that I did in Minnesota, I had a good time during the trip. I did feel sad when Mark seemed rather withdrawn from everyone by my observation, but I hope that I can improve things for him. I regretted the time he came over to hightower when everyone had gone home, and after a while I went into the basement to play Dragon Age 2, which I did not enjoy much after a while, and left him alone upstairs to play call of duty instead of spending as much time as I could with him. I felt like a dick for doing that, along with introducing him to league of legends. Alas, I think he too will have to learn the hard way that I didn't find league of legends a useful skill. Although I do think that perhaps it could teach a person some useful skills. \n\n7:38:43 AM: I want to start using E-Prime as much as I can. I want to revise this wiki software so that it will highlight uses of 'is'. I believe I will find it beneficial to only use 'is' for magic.\n\n3:34:10 PM: Daria sleeps for now. I feel tired, a side effect of getting up early. Haven't done much yet today except for what I got done before noon. Would like to accomplish more.\n\n3:35:14 PM: Read some articles by FRATER.BARRABBAS that I found quite interesting, about sex magick and the like.\n\n10:10:58 PM: Saw Federico at the office when I went in to pickup Daria's maca root extract and bath robe. I feel excited at the prospect of experiencing what this maca root can do. And I think I will feel blessed when the maca root relieves suspected SSRI caused dysfunction. \n\nI observed that Federico seemed well. He told me he lost money in bitcoin and the stock market recently, but did not appear too upset about it. He expressed excitement at the prospect of the new teams, and said that he would talk to Brian about forming a team with me.\n\n12:23:48 AM: Tried a cocktail of one beer, a squirt full of salvia extract, an unknown (but very small) amount of maca root powder in milk and then had sex. I found it very interesting as I had a huge revelation. Daria didn't orgasm after , like many times before. We tried multiple positions with intercourse and didn't have any success. Then I tried fingering her and still didn't have any success after both my hands tired out. Then as she touched herself I hit upon the winning idea. I masturbated to her. As soon as I started to feel good and moan, so did she. As I came so did she. The problems we had seem to stem from my own lack of pleasure. To really please her, I have to act pleased. Ramsey Duke explained in his excellent article the Magician or the Charlatan. To perform sex magick I just have to fake really enjoying it, which then leads to actually really enjoying, which then leads to Daria really enjoying. I can perform as a sex magician simply by faking it. If you fake it till you make it you actually make it. ","updated":{"$date":"2013-12-27T05:59:03.535Z"},"url":"12_26_2013"}

I woke up not feeling too well, having found that an itch in my throat evolved into soreness. However, later in the day using the power of Placebo I fought off my maladies for the most part.\n\nI feel curious about the way the body blocks off nasal passages during sickness. According to the yogic theory each nasal passage brings in a different kind of prana into the body, and pranic imbalance causes sickness. In that case, perhaps the body naturally blocks off nasal passages in order to restore balance as necessary, and clearing out the nose counteracts the body's natural efforts.\n\nI find E-Prime interesting because it both eliminates a lot of ambiguity but also forces me to eliminate certain waste word phrases, and it forces me to write in active tense, because I can't write passive sentences using the normal forms. \n\nI feel intrigued by the idea of using Ben Franklin's daily schedule that I read about earlier today, but I think I would have to modify it a bit.

I remember Mark quarreling with my parents  again. Mom had this sheet of Chinese QA for her business that dad brought up, I don't know what that had to do with the argument. I played a game with Andy where I had a few characters of different types. I remember Daria with me. I remember I read a list of abilities that I could acquire through magic along with examples of cool uses for those abilities, and I told Daria that I wanted to master them all or something to that extent. Luke wanted to play a different game with me up at night. We tried to hide from dad past our bedtime basically. \n\n8:27:02 AM: I find that writing in E-Prime gets easier and easier for me.

I had just put down the illuminatus trilogy to take a nap and I had some really weird dreams with Daria. Daria had a clone that she planned to kill. Daria had really weird hair. I kept trying to wake up out of these creepy dreams and ended up in another creepy dream. .I felt struck in dreams where I slept in the position that I slept in, so it felt like I could able to wakeup but couldn't. Really strange.\n\n5:24:07 PM: Made Daria come with my hands today. I have observed that moaning in pleasure during sex helps me stay in the moment and enjoy it more, and so it acts as a self fulfilling prophecy just as Ramsey Dukes explained. A very enjoyable time through and through. Also the Mantak Chia's powerlock most certainly works for controlling orgasm.\n\n10:10:41 PM: Still feeling relatively weird.

His Github only has projects he worked with other people on, and he barely has any commits in either repo. \n\nAudigram appears incomplete project (and didn't appear hosted anywhere) and due to the format I can't determine how much of it he wrote.\n\nHis \"Reversi AI\" comprises a sketchy looking implementation of reversi's rules. That appeared difficult for him in of itself, so the \"AI\" turned out to simply pick moves at random.\n\nOverall I do not find his writing convincingly passionate or interesting.\n\n-----\n\nCan't access Bitbucket. I felt intrigued by his writing. I found a dearth of  evidence that he can code well. From what I can surmise from his Github he tends to mash the code until it works. He likes to make twenty commits all with the same commit message such as \"progress\". He could certainly use an introduction to engineering practice through HackNY. Most of his repos seemed empty. I don't think I would consider him a good programmer.","title":"Thu Jan 02 2014","updated":{"$date":"2014-01-03T05:57:33.430Z"},"url":"1_2_2014"}

I attempted to do as Nausicaa would do. Even though he had hurt me in the past, I still tried to get to know him, asking about which tattoo he got first, and such. Oddly enough he worked at the hotel where I stayed. I ordered crazy ice cream on Seamless for delivery to the hotel lobby. I had to leave soon. A woman hotel staffer delivered the ice cream to me, and I started packing stuff up. I had a moral conflict when I had the choice to take a micro-usb charger that didn't belong to me.

Last night I gave up two desires. My desire for Maya in exchange for Daria's health and love. My desire for masturbation to pornography for improved eyesight. I have to be up early tomorrow, so I think I will do a bit of reading, take a bath and then KAP and go to sleep.\n\n12:50:11 PM: Hm, the inflight internet doesn't exactly seem to be working, but that's quite alright, as my journal will still work in offline mode thanks to the magic of Meteor. Last night's KAP was interesting, as at the end I was getting kriyas or spontaneous movements that were quite interesting. \n\n12:51:31 PM: I'd have to say I am pretty happy with how this trip turned out. I feel that I have achieved some closure with various issues that have been bothering me. Flight 23 was indeed a flight of destiny. Hm, perhaps the Go Go internet network is overloaded at this point. I will have to try again later. The only downside of this trip is that I really missed out on a lot of training, but that's okay. I think I might order some food here.\n\n2:38:58 PM: Having some weird head sensations going on today. Pretty deep inside the left hemisphere, but also all over. It's always encouraging to feel the rewiring going on. I think the majority of what the kundalini does is just rewire the brain so that it can move the energy appropriately through the rest of the body, which is why I have concentrated by efforts on healing the brain. Once my brain is fully functional and integrated (I hope to merge the left and right hemispheres so that they are fully capable of working in concert) then I think the rest will be easy. I am hoping that I will be able to achieve full ambidexterity through the process of merging the hemispheres, and I expect that better coordination between the eyes will improve my vision as well.\n\n4:36:00 PM: Somehow, I'm not exactly sure how, I managed to do something that made me almost completely blind in my left eye for quite a while. It was alarming to say the least. I did the KAP meditation again, and my vision seems to have normalized again. Dr. Morris wrote that during the kundalini process he went blind for a little while, so perhaps this is just part of the healing process. I wouldn't be surprised if my vision temporarily gets worse before it returns to being very good. This is a very interesting process to say the least. The KAP meditation never fails to get me sweaty, so I guess that is the yang energy heating me up. Doing it on the airplane was okay this time, but I cut myself off before I started doing kriyas and potentially disturbing people around me. Still had some wandering thoughts today but that has been improving. In addition to this I should just practice golden flower meditation, because that teaches several essential skills.","title":"Fri Dec 13 2013","updated":{"$date":"2013-12-13T21:38:41.572Z"},"url":"12_13_2013"}

My parents start to quiz me on Chinese in the stairwell of my home and they realize that I don't know any characters. I say that pinyin seems a perfectly good writing system in frustration. Before that I went shopping with Mark, Luke, and Priscilla for snacks to bring on the trip. Priscilla and I primarily looked for candy. Oh, Daria came with too. I found these crackers and \"super salty cheese mix\". We also considered getting jolly ranchers. Before that I travelled with dad to India or somewhere very dirty. I climbed a big monument during a moment when people had an argument with dad, because a woman in our group claimed \"England was Europe\" and dad said that \"England was only part of Europe\". E-Prime would have helped them. Somehow these people seemed part of a school board? Someone in the group felt really upset. Ian from hightower stayed in India with us? My family stayed in a very strange hotel with rooms that had different features and I couldn't find my family, but I knew where Daria fell asleep. I remember a girl with Daria and I but I don't remember who. The hotel had a really strange open layout and very poor privacy and it had all these different sections with different sleeping features. \n\n#### Exercise\n\n7:14:39 AM: One OSPU each side.\n\n#### Yoga\n\n8:50:02 AM: Had class with Fergus today, who I only met today. It felt amazing. A great workout. Some challenging poses that I can't do yet. Really felt the energy during it too. When we laid in corpse pose at the end, I felt a lot in my head. I experimented with not keeping my tongue on the roof of my mouth like Dr. Morris suggests. The energy went to my head when I did that. So it seems keeping the tongue on the roof of the mouth prevents the energy from going to the head before I can handle it.\n\n#### Taijutsu\n\n8:54:17 AM: Going to do two full sets of hicho no kata as my practice for today. \n\n9:01:38 AM: Did one set of tsuki on each side and one set of hicho no kata on each side.\n\n#### Plan Day\n\n*Intention*: Today I intend to help as many people as I can with their problems and give selflessly wherever possible with a bright and cheery attitude. Today I intend to establish healthy and beneficial habits that I can build a solid foundation for my life upon.\n\nTo that end, I will go to work because I believe I will enjoy it. That way I can meditate with Federico in the afternoon, which I love doing. I would establish that as a habit too. Now I shall shower, meditate, and go into work.\n\n#### Meditate\n\n9:52:07 AM: Pretty good concentration today, felt the energy very well. I would have to venture that the yoga practice will prove very beneficial to my kundalini awakening. Perhaps that should come as no surprise, considering the indians developed it specifically for that reason. I think that next time I won't lie flat on the floor, because it hurt the back of my head, but I did like it. I think I will just use the mats next time.\n\n#### Sailthru\n\n- [x] Look into list count failure that occurred on Jan 4th for ticket 10107. Need to write a script to find all the clients and lists that need recounting. Can use the day before and check each stats.list.day if the next day exists or not. Then we can use the stat_list_fudge_improved script to actually fix the lists once we have identified all of them. Okay, well, looks like we have to keep running this script until it finally finishes doing all the computations.\n- [x] Handle 10193 for Satia. Got this running on pg3 in the screen \"big_ass_job\" still need to transfer over the file when it finishes.\n- [x] Respond to Nazim on ticket 10100\n- [x] Case 10051\n- [x] Case 10049\n\nNote to self: that 5 GB file upload limit on s3 keeps biting us in the butt, I think I want to fix it.\n\n12:10:00 PM: php list_stat_fudge_improved.php --client 1070 --stat_day 20140104 --list \"whatever\" --update true\nEB Owner List ````` 4475\n\nWait for this script to finish has me a bit nervous.

It acts like a feedback loop, soon we will have truly crazy mindblowing amazing orgiastic sex.\n\n9:53:46 AM: Well, now that my day feels off to a fantastic start I think I shall go to Sailthru and see if I will myself to have a fantastically productive day. I hope that they announce the new teams today because I would love to know. I would like to thank mom for the great haircut she gave me. I really dig it and so does Daria.\n\n10:12:05 AM: Alright, here I sit at work. It felt pretty damn cold outside, but since my walk only takes seven minutes I didn't think too much of it. While I walked I did notice my vision seems to have improved. I had several of those elusive \"moments of sharpness\" where I could see everything in crisp detail from a distance. I expect that as I continue my vision improvement regimen my vision will continue improving in leaps and bounds. Now, let's check on Sailthru. I've got an hour or so before all hands. I think I will take some of that time to arrange my thoughts and eat breakfast.\n\n3:36:08 PM: I don't particularly enjoy this drama at work. Perhaps I wouldn't mind if I didn't get assigned to Matt G's team. \n\n5:56:40 PM: Aw, KitKat just kissed me when I came home. I gave him a treat because he acted so cute.\n\n6:06:17 PM: Overall I had a great day at work today, and I feel very happy about my team assignment. It worked out great. I'd like to consult the yijing and tarot about my team later tonight.\n\n8:28:57 PM: Went to TJ's with Daria. A lot of people stood in the line, as usual.\n\n11:04:32 PM: Idea: write versions of my software explicitly stated. The MBOS project.\n\n11:05:18 PM: I feel good about today. I accomplished what I set out to do, I feel pleased with my new team. I feel excited for tomorrow.

Felt like I still studied at college at this time. Mom and Dad asked me lots of questions about what I did and I acted defensive about it. Dad drove me to the library and I felt really upset because I left a lot of stuff at home, but he meant to just bring me there to pick up some stuff and then we would go back home and pick up the rest of my stuff and actually take me home. Mom wanted to give me a short haircut. Dreamed about this strange game that seemed like an underwater super meatboy. In the game you go back in time to battle the final enemy. Dreamed the Levi wanted to do boxing but took a really long time and didn't have much training. Visited a friend with children at his apartment that resembled a hotel room. His children looked like Luke the half-black son of my fomer chemistry teacher. The apartment looked very small, it contained two beds and a TV and not much else. Dad worked for a lady who worked at a game company somehow \n\n#### Exercise\n\n8:43:40 AM: Felt too tired to this before yoga. I would not muster my strength to do it. Will circle around back to this later.\n\n9:00:50 PM: One set of moderate OSPU, one set of slow OSPU each side.\n\n#### Yoga\n\n8:44:19 AM: Had class with Deanna this morning. Pretty tough class, I chose to take child's pose a few times during class. Feel very blissful afterwards however. I think I will have to adjust my sequence since after yoga I would not muster my strength to do taijutsu. Instead I think that I will meditate first.\n\n#### Meditate\n\n8:58:02 AM: Alright, time to do KAP meditation. This time I will lie in bed. The floor felt too hard last time.\n\n9:38:09 AM: Good energy flow today. Decent concentration. I got distracted a bit between the earth and water chakra, but that resolved itself as I brought my attention back.\n\n#### Taijutsu\n\n9:39:45 AM: I think I will practice two sets of tsuki on each side, just to give my practice some momentum. But since I also have class today, and I feel pretty stretched from yoga I won't push myself too hard today.\n\n9:42:53 AM: Okay, that went alright I think.\n\n8:27:31 PM: Class with just Mike and James at Josh's place. We learned tsuki-eri which I can't do yet. We kept practicing that elusive movement that causes the arm twist, just like with the jutte movements that we have done in the past. James and Mike described it as a vortex pulling the arm in. I don't know if that description holds true, as Josh didn't chime in supporting it. I believe we have to transfer the weight of the body through the hand, just as we do in many other movements. \n\n8:29:20 PM: In terms of my tsuki I have to work on getting my hips in profile. Right now they are turning forward. Hopefully I can check for that in the mirror and see it if it happens.\n\n#### Plan Day\n\nIntention: Extend my kindness to everyone I meet.\n\n- [x] Write to David about the new pricing model.\n- [x] Setup appointment to get Kitkat neutered in the afternoon. Friday 8:30-9:00 am drop off.\n- [x] Get UPS package delivered properly.\n\n#### Sailthru\n\n- [x] Fix problem in 10049 where we perform unnecessary loads of topusers array because I love performance. \n- [x] Clear out remaining Fogbugz queue by filling work into the outstanding spreadsheet that Brian created, because I love my team.\n- [x] Check on progress of Patch backfill. Because I love Ashley and Patch.\n- [x] [9948](https://sailthru.fogbugz.com/default.asp?7221) because I love Boris.\n- [x] Ask Satia for support cases if everything else gets done, because I love the support team.\n- [x]  9099\n- [x] 9925 \n- [x] Follow up with Ann on 9749 because I love her. And follow up with Nazim because I love Nazim.\n- [x] Investigate possible DB issue tying together 10083, 9099, and 9925, 9749. Possible that the bigmap just needs deployment to proc nodes. Okay, so I don't think the DB issue comes into play here. Looks like null pointer exceptions and other simple code issues.\n- [x] Fix devtools to not assign the ticket to a reviewer if the owner doesn't want it reviewed yet, because I love my team.\n\n#### Personal Projects\n\n#### Journal\n\n10:01:39 AM: I scoop kitkat's litter because I love him. I will get him neutered because I love him and because I love Daria.\n\n11:01:32 AM: Did a tarot spread today about the future of my new team at Sailthru. Haven't entirely figured it out yet, although the querent section seems pretty straightforward. I would have to guess that the Princess of Swords represents Kristie in this spread. I don't know who the Queen of Cups or the Knight of Cups represent though.\n\n3:43:14 PM: I really enjoyed the quantum mechanics lecture today. I enjoyed it quite a bit. \n\n4:04:35 PM: I would like to make several enhancements to this wiki presently. I think this wiki will become DeftDraft.\n\n8:40:05 PM: I feel good about today on the whole. I accomplished a lot at Sailthru, and I continued my roll of keeping good habits. I probably still have some rearranging to do. I feel slightly down, but maybe I just feel tired. I think I feel a little discouraged by how much Mike and James goof off during class.

,{"_id":"mygXa79QnEq9JSqJF","active":true,"name":"13","prose":"rPggkKuYfaSPro3TJ","text":"#### Dream Journal\n\nDreamed that I assassinated  the Chairman of China, somehow still the ruler of China, by having him hug me while my clothes had a poison only he had a vulnerability to. I plotted this with a radical artist who put on a performance art exhibit in Beijing. The art itself looked shockingly anti-government to me, but you had to understand English. This happened at a huge art exhibit where I went with Daria. All sorts of strange occurrences there. The art looked strange. The only piece of art I specifically remember looked like a moving black couch that one would sit on that moved about in a small ring. Depending on where it moved you would hear audio messages that only the person sitting on the couch could hear. I think the artist did this so that he could play anti-government messages to people without the guards knowing. Daria and I did some weird and apparently illegal money conversions with tourists from other countries who also happened to stay at the exhibit. I remember exchanging $50 for 100 Kroner with a Norwegian lady. Eventually I got through all the guards and metal detectors and arrived at that one exhibit I mentioned remembering. On the walls of the exhibit I saw the artist give the signal in the messages, saying the time had come to act. I went over to the Chairman and started conversing with him. He showed me with weird mushy staff thing, which he told me he made by melting people's bodies into a mold at his farm. I didn't believe that he actually made the stick things out of humans, so I asked him what evidence remained of human remains in those. Meanwhile I really squished hard on parts of it and it snapped. I apologized profusely for breaking it, afraid that he would feel angry and have me killed. Instead he forgave me very graciously. I took this chance to hug him in gratitude, whereupon he remarked that I smelled strange and then died. Then I and the artist began our escape, running out through his exhibition. He asked me if I had \"taken the papers\" which I said I hadn't, and he looked sad. I think I needed an antidote or something and so I would die, but somehow I also got the sense that I considered it a suicide mission and had accepted that death would go along with my role in this scheme.\n\nDiscussing drugs with my dad, especially marijuana which he tried. And also acid. I climbed a tree with him and bonded while I told him about different drug experiences I had. He came to New York City and had a huge insightful moment smoking acid and overlooking the city, talked about how he learned about disruptive technology involving trucks and satellite technology. Before that at Sailthru where I threatened to quit if this one girl dev couldn't keep her job, because I felt upset that Sailthru's management kept firing devs and barely hiring any. This weird combination of Chris Chapman and my dad (I see Chris as a father figure? Perhaps) told me that she had disengaged, and that she made a lot of noise, distracting the devs, so she had to go. I don't remember exactly who she resembled. Sailthru's office had really grown huge at that point.\n\n#### Exercise\n\n#### Yoga\n\n8:36:42 AM: Had class with Christine today, another new instructor. Really enjoyed it, she emphasized the pranayama aka meditation which I enjoyed.\n\n#### Meditate\n\n8:37:30 AM: Now, while I still feel relaxed from meditation and I feel the energy flowing, I will KAP.\n\n9:18:18 AM: Blacked out for a bit between the heart chakra and the orgasm feeling, but my body must have gone along with it. Doing yoga before hand feels like it strengthens the whole experience. Very strong feelings of energy today. I think that I may nap before I do taijutsu.\n\n#### Taijutsu\n\n10:01:06 AM: Let's see if I can get my hips in line when doing tsuki.\n\n10:02:57 AM: Kind of, but I feel hard pressed to do it right after yoga. My legs still feel wobbly. Did one tsuki on each side. Will do more later in the day. \n\n6:00:14 PM: One set of tsuki on each side, without mirror. I tried to keep my hips in line, however.\n\n#### Plan Day\n\n10:00:30 AM: Intention for the day: continue building my foundation of doing it now out of love. Especially meditating with Federico.\n\n10:06:59 AM: Hopefully I can meet up with Jordan today, if not  \n\n#### Sailthru\n\n- [x] 10274. Fix the horrible patch stats.\n\n\n[sailthru@inny-procgen01 crons]$ for i in {1..30}; do php client_stats_patch.php --day \"November $i 2013\"; done\n\n#### Projects\n\n#### Journal\n\n9:24:04 AM: I feel that Kitkat as my familiar sometimes. He wakes me up when I should work on something. I will work on my tarot interpretation of yesterday.\n\nCenter: (2 Cups) Love, (9 Cups) Happiness, the Fool. That describes my current state and future possibility. I feel happy. I feel in love. The fool represents that I have begun a journey with the attitude of a beginner. The fool represents an attitude I have sought to evoke. \"The Fool has the number 0, for someone ready to go in any direction, open to all possibilities. He belongs nowhere, has no past, but an infinite future.\"\n\nUpper left possibility: Failure (7 Disks), Ruin (10 Swords), Queen of Swords. I don't know what the queen of swords represents here, but I feel clearly that this spread represents a grim future indeed where I would learn from my mistakes. It seems I would meet both intellectual and financial disaster here. \"The Queen of Swords can seem very sensitive, perceptive, sharp-witted and intelligent. On the dark side, she can turn cruel, malicious, narrow-minded, bigoted or even deceitful, dangerous, too, because of her charm and beauty.\" I will stay on the lookout for such a person and know to avoid a future with him or her.\n\nUpper right possibility: The Aeon, The Hierophant, Pleasure (6 Cups). This spread seems to me a very good future.  Pleasure I feel very happy about, indicating the balancing of the cups cards I got in the center. I like both 2 and 9 of cups, but 6 I feel great about. *Aeon*: \"Knowledge of coherences, widened perception and the liberation of hidden abilities\" that I like. *Hierophant*: \"the Hierophant represents the search for knowledge and illumination, the desire to study creed and dogma instead of simply accepting them, to research and achieve further development. It also stands for the deep fulfillment someone can find when really trusting their own beliefs.\" This seems to be the spiritual results if I can reach 20. Contemplation as indicated by the tarot.\n\nBottom left, factors to consider: Ace of Disks, 2 of Swords, Wheel of Fortune. Honestly, I don't know what to make of any of these. Both of the pips feel very abstract to me, and Wheel of Fortune seems a total wildcard. I suppose the 1 of disks could mean I should look out for opportunities and the seedling of a great investment. The two of swords indicates how I should use my intellect. \n\nBottom right, factors outside my control: Queen of Cups, Princess of Swords, Knight of Cups. I thought this the most interesting part of the spread. The factors outside my control clearly represent my team assignment, which indeed did not lie in my control. \"The Queen of Cups represents water in water, she represents the purest manifestation of the soul of the waters. Thus she represents pure emotion, passion, feeling, never influenced by judgement or purpose. She acts loving and affectionate, a warm-hearted mother and a tender friend, looking into the depths of the heart.\" She might represent Federico, that sounds like him. \"the Princess of Swords can get stubborn and cruel, and while beginning to think independently about something, she can turn very discriminating and egoistic, showing aggressiveness whenever the result does not delight her. At her best, the Princess of Swords can act very practical and clever, showing fine skills when dealing with material matters or conflicting opinions, she can act generous and kind once she lost the inner fear and insecurity\" She sounds like Kristie almost exactly. Knight of Cups often represents me (I feel I have a dual personality between the Knight of Cups and Prince of Wands), but he probably represents Eric Weiser. I don't think he represents Boris, doesn't fit based on what I know.\n\n- [x] Ask Wylie and Alex about Jordan's dietary concerns because I love Jordan.\n\n1:20:09 PM: Had a nice conversation with Vik and Neil and Ann at lunch today. Vik used to do two hours of meditation a day and wants to get back into it. Neil expressed interest in meditation too and Ann told me that she did it in the airport since airports stress her out. \n\n4:26:41 PM: Ten minute mindfulness meditation with Federico, Max, and Lisa Kim felt surprisingly difficult. Perhaps I have gone too easy on myself with the KAP guided meditation and I should supplement my practice with my mindfulness meditation. I think that would assist my KAP meditation in any case. \n\n6:00:09 PM: Dev team meeting today didn't feel all that productive to me, but it did clarify to me what people regarded with importance. I guess it went alright. Probably won't get to any personal projects today because I have friends coming over, but I feel very happy and excited about that. I have the apartment all cleaned up and ready for people to visit and I think I have the room setup in a welcoming manner. It seems I won't finish Illuminatus tonight, but in fairness I do find it a very long book. And due to the way my mind keeps getting blown while reading it, it may continue to prove a slow read. I plan to act the gracious host while still getting to bed at a reasonable hour and keeping up my good habits. I realized that I will encounter some challenges ahead, such as the kaceminar and hack@brown regarding my habits and it will prove essential that I stay flexible and yet return to my habits as quickly as possible when circumstances allow.\n\n6:03:24 PM: Hopefully I can fulfill 20. Contemplation and become a shining example and beacon of meditation at Sailthru. I make that my goal now out of love. I shall act as though Sailthru represents my monastery. \n\n11:48:51 PM: Had a lot of fun with Jordan and Jenn. We played Boss Monster. Jordan told me about his enchantment practice. He still has the crystal I gave him. He has a Firefly talisman that represents persistence against all odds, a Viper talisman that represents skill, a runic bracelet saying \"Truth burns\". Jordan feels concerned about Aaron, and I share his concern. I hope that I could help him somehow. \n\n11:51:34 PM: I also had a good time entertaining Daria's friends when they came over. Howie, Jane Kim, and Chris Yan came over and we talked.","title":"Thu Jan 09 2014","updated":{"$date":"2014-01-10T15:46:15.556Z"},"url":"1_9_2014"}

I felt that the class went slower, which helped me work on doing several of the poses more correctly. I had to sit in child's pose for a few minutes during one part because it got too intense for me. I think if my breathing gets out of sync with the movement it becomes very difficult, so I find it important to remain mindful of the breath. \n\n#### Meditate\n\n12:26:49 PM: I think that I shall meditate now for a while. \n\n#### Taijutsu\n\n#### Plan Day\n\n8:59:19 AM: Have a great day in the company of friends and enjoy much merriment. \n\n#### Sailthru\n\n#### Projects\n\n#### Journal\n\n10:13:39 AM: Daria is feeling insecure about her programming ability again. I don't know what to do about it when that happens. I think that I just have to act patient with her and love her, and eventually she will get over it. I wish that she wouldn't compare herself to others, because that has always seemed to me a guaranteed way to feel unhappy. There will always exist people in this world who possess greater skills and greater resources. I just want to focus on what I can do with what I have, not on what I don't have. But maybe Daria really doesn't want to become a programmer, and I feel fine about that too. She needs to make up her mind and figure out what she really wants. Do what thou wilt, and what not. It feels to me like she doesn't have any examples except those that her friends at Columbia and HackNY have shown her, so she feels that she has to follow a similar path, when in reality she really doesn't. She could forge her own path and it would turn out great. \n\n10:23:00 AM: Well, she stormed out of the apartment, and without her yoga mat, which concerns me because I don't want her to miss yoga. I don't know what she wants to do right now... I guess I will just go to yoga, because I won't let this derail my day. \n\n11:56:42 AM: I felt relieved when I realized at yoga that Daria had her mat in front of me. She still won't talk to me, and she  has curled up in her blanket on the bed, but at least she did get to yoga, which makes me feel better. I feel sad that I didn't act more supportive and encouraging earlier. I think I acted patronizing or dismissive of her fears. \n\n12:00:18 PM: Let me just say that I find it very nice to have my mechanical keyboard at home. I really find it a joy to type on. Now I think perhaps I could make some upgrades to my software.\n\n12:02:52 PM: Sometimes when our relationship feels strained like this I feel guilty because I start to wonder who else exists out there. For example the girl to my right in yoga today looked very cute, but I do have a bias that makes anyone who does yoga more attractive to me. Anyway, I don't like feeling that way, so I hope that I can strengthen my relationship with Daria and figure out how to act better when she feels upset. Today what I did just felt entirely wrong. I did not listen to her and receive her words and respond to them using non-violent communication and I find that a huge mistake. I could have avoided this current awkwardness where I sit here alone in a room by myself if I had just listened and reflected her feelings.

Dreamed that I went to a hackathon with Daria and met Dave Fontenot there. Dave's friends from high school looked for him and couldn't find him and asked if I knew where he had gone. I found out from Dave that he wanted to get away from his friends in high school because they didn't exert a good influence on him. I traveled down a trail with Daria through some woods and we ran very fast. Then we reached a frozen lake with the moon bright in the sky. \n\n#### Exercise\n\n#### Yoga\n\n2:24:38 PM: Did class with Fergus again this afternoon, thanks to Daria's prompting. Daria treats me so well. Felt loads of energy today. Still very interested in how Fergus tells us to remove the tongue from the roof of the mouth, contrary to what Dr. Morris teaches. When I remove my tongue I feel a lot more energy surging into my head. I suppose in yoga they desire that, but in qi gong they want to avoid kundalini syndrome so first they open the microcosmic orbit and then they open the macrocosmic orbit. \n\n#### Meditate\n\n2:26:06 PM: Meditated during yoga for quite a bit actually. \n\n#### Taijutsu\n\n2:26:39 PM: Ought to practice this today when I feel recovered from yoga. \n\n#### Plan Day\n\n2:26:20 PM: Clean up a bit, read\n\n- [] Send Jordan the details for meeting up today. \n\n#### Sailthru\n\n2:26:52 PM: Not working today.\n\n#### Projects\n\n2:26:57 PM: On hold today because friends.\n\n#### Journal\n\n2:27:13 PM: I feel pretty proud of yesterday. Despite a rocky start, we ended the day well. I won a game of paranoia risk by very carefully manipulating people into helping me, and giving no information away as to who I had as my target. Then we played a game of Catan, which I almost won. During the game the vibe between Randall and Jon Gottfried did not feel great, so I tried to ease tensions, and I also meditated and smiled a lot. I think that I could have felt frustrated at ending up a point away from victory if I hadn't meditated. Then we went to this awesome goat cheese ice cream shop. \n\n2:29:01 PM: Then Daria asked me for a Tarot reading, which I felt very excited by. She asked how the year would go and I followed the instructions in the manual, performing the opening ceremony. At least in my experience so far, it really helps to perform that ceremony. Every time that I have that I can remember there has occurred an incredible coincidence that probability makes very inexplicable. In particular this time for the querent portion of the spread we got Prince of Wands, Prince of Disks, and Knight of Cups. Both the Prince of Wands and the Knight of Cups represent aspects of me, meaning the Prince of  Disks represent Daria. We gathered from the reading that we ought to focus on finishing projects and making sure that we have good follow through on the ideas we start. If we did, we would have a great year and make some very important new friends. \n\n2:34:52 PM: I really enjoyed the illuminatus trilogy. Still finishing the appendices where RAW makes some of the secrets a little more clear. That book contains many mini-initiations in my opinion. \n\n11:37:37 PM: Had fun with Jordan and Jenn and Daria and Lisa and Andy and new Jeremy at Andy's apartment. We played King of Tokyo and Resistance and watched Adventure Time. I found the Adventure Time episode on lucid dreaming  very interesting. I now feel ready to start tomorrow off to a great start with yoga and my morning routine again. It turns out Jeremy has interesting wares.

Perhaps I will train meditate when I go pick up kitkat right now.\n\n6:57:24 PM: Meditated a bit throughout the day, but didn't specifically devote any time to it.\n\n#### Taijutsu\n\n4:12:20 PM: I still can't do ichimonji correctly. My hips do not come onto the line correctly yet. Same with ko-ichimonji. That completely explains my problems with tsuki. I hope I can get my hips open enough to do these movements properly soon.\n\n6:56:52 PM: One set of tsuki on each side, trying to open the hips. Weren't great. Now that I really look at my form I notice all sorts of problems with my legs and hips. I have much to work on still.\n\n#### Plan Day\n\n4:29:45 PM: Intention for the day: flexibly adjust my routine around present circumstances, continue to act from the center with calm and love, broadcast a message of inner peace and love.\n\n- [x] Get Kitkat to Gotham Vet. \n- [x] Buy wine and meet Jordan to go with him to dinner party. \n\n#### Sailthru\n\n#### Projects\n\n#### Journal\n\n10:47:34 AM: Took kitkat to get neutered today. I feel pretty mixed about it. On one hand, everyone tells me that to protect his health I should do it. On the other hand, I don't feel that we should keep an animal as a pet if we don't accept the way it exists without modification. But I did feel better after I saw that the people at the clinic seemed nice and seemed to care about the animals. I trust that they won't hurt Kitkat unnecessarily. They will use anesthesia of course, but I still worry about how Kitkat will act after the operation. After dropping him off I also went to pick up some wine for the dinner party at Wylie's apartment tonight. I feel excited for that.  \n\n1:50:00 PM: Well, porn just has nothing on Daria anymore. I love her so much. Kitkat's surgery has finished, according to the man who just called. I took a nap, I guess I have missed some sleep lately. Still feel a bit groggy, but I want to get to the things I want to do.\n\n6:49:54 PM: Smiled like crazy on the subway. I have noticed the self fulfilling effects and self fueling chain reaction effect of the smile. \n\n6:55:43 PM: Noticed a lot of vision improvements today. I need to buy an eye chart so I can specifically record my progress. \n\n6:57:39 PM: I will head out for Wylie's dinner party soon, and perhaps Uncommons after that.\n\n1:18:29 AM: Oh yeah, earlier today I helped a woman with a baby carriage get through the subway door.\n\n1:18:16 AM: Had a great time at dinner with Jordan. I met James, Sarah, and Roshaine. I enjoyed their company immensely, along with Wylie and Alex. I learned that I can get a mit.edu email address if I ask Jesse nicely. We talked about a wide range of issues including busting the two party system, the civil war, how people teach history in elementary schools and beyond, free software vs open source and Richard Stallman (I should read his biography), the time Wylie and Alex got in trouble with the law trying to break into the redhook grain towers, brewster's system design.

Then we left before my order arrived.  Dreamed that Luke stayed home by himself with a nanny and he had the power to control select elements. I hung out with Lisa and Andy. On board a space ship we negotiated with aliens. Our ship apparently got sabotaged at one point and the captain felt frantic about fixing it, a little girl had to comfort him. \n\n9:30:41 AM: Dreamt that for some reason three college students had to move in with us. \n\n10:01:59 AM: Dreamt that mom and dad invited me to a Facebook event for their anniversary which. It turned out that they were going to a yoga class together, which I went to with the siblings. Since we did not sign up for the class, we observed from the side. I attended a big college lecture style class with Daphne. Afterwards during a break in the class I asked her if she wanted to throw frisbee disks around outside. She noted that the ground looked wet, so we played indoors with a friend of hers. We threw around a truly ridiculous number of frisbees in a few hallways. Later I laid in bed by myself and fell halfway between waking and dreaming. I started hearing strange sounds in my head that I could change by shifting my head. It sounded as if I could tune into radio frequencies. I tuned around a bit, and then suddenly I tuned too hard and I came out of my body, and I sat outside my body looking at it with my own copied physical body. Something told me that I had to kill my double, or at least leave without getting seen by it. I started trying to strangle him but he woke up and saw me and I had too much heart to kill him. Then we decided to team up. \n\n#### Yoga\n\n8:37:25 AM: Very nice class today with Joe. I felt a lot of energy during Bridge and Full Wheel, those seem like very powerful poses. Despite feeling tired this morning, powered through it. \n\n#### Meditate\n\n10:14:14 AM: Honestly, I felt like I dozed off most of the day, but maybe my body handled the meditation prompts for me because I still felt good at the end. \n\n#### Plan Day\n\n8:38:01 AM: *Intention for the day*: love my future selves by firmly establishing my habits today. \n\n8:39:11 AM: *Mission for the day*:  do now out of love for as many people as I can. \n\n#### Sailthru\n\n- [x] 10107 because I love Johnson.\n\n#### Taijutsu\n\n3:31:59 PM: Have class today.\n\n8:13:21 PM: After much vacillating I decided to go to class despite wanting to assemble the loft. I decided that I manifest enough manliness to do literally everything in a single day, so I did both yoga and taijutsu today. I feel very grateful to my past self for deciding to do that, because I learned many useful ideas today. For tsuki I need to immediately rotate and lock my back leg, release all tension in the groin so that I can drop forward properly. And I should practice shifting back into ichimonji from tsuki. Also I should practice rotating from tsuki to ichimonji while keeping my weight on the original front foot the entire time. That rotation occurs in the middle of the foot, not on the ball of the foot. New Justin who seemed to have previous bujinkan experience but at a really bad dojo joined James and I with Josh. Justin's form almost made me cringe but I stayed polite and helped him where I could. I suppose in time I have become a sempai too. I still have a lot of improvement to make on my bo technique. We did an interesting technique that I do not remember the name of. When they tsuki from shizentai we catch their hand with our leading hand and the hanbo (we face the same way as they do). Then shifting forward onto our front foot, we transfer our weight into his hand, pulling the hand towards our back hip (this looks like a sword draw here). Then we rotate in, keeping our weight still on that same foot, smacking them in the face. We also did the inverse of the one rotating hanbo technique from the other side. As they tsuki, we ichimonji back at an angle and hit their ribs with the hanbo (we face the same way). Then we grab their hand as we shift our weight forward, bringing their balance behind them. We insert the hanbo behind them into their armpit and anchoring their hand with our hand, we rotate the stick across their back to throw them. \n\n#### Projects\n\n- [x] Bring mallet home to assemble loft bed.\n\n#### Journal\n\n11:21:42 AM: Found a loft bed disassembled just a block away from my apartment today and I took it home. Seems that fortune favors the bold, it didn't even take me all that long to drag the whole thing in here. I think that I will build the loft and put the bed where the futon resides right now and put the futon under it, and then I can setup the desk in here so that Daria can use the ethernet cord at the desk. And then the pantry will basically have nothing in it, so I can use it as a temple and dojo. \n\n8:21:35 PM: Okay, time to get back to assembling that loft. So far I have had an adventure with it, scrambling to the hardware store, salvaging what few pieces we've got. It'll turn out very interestingly I think. I think it'll be safe to sleep on, but I feel doubtful about sex. Probably have to sexercise on the mats. Two days ago I gave Daria an incredible orgasm, but I couldn't yesterday. She feels weird in her vagina, I think going back on lexapro might have caused it, since she stopped for over a week when her prescription ran out.

I just got up with Daria and I've completely lost my dream memory at this point. I will now feed KitKat I suppose.\n\n11:17:17 AM: Dreamed that I dug up a bunch of hard gum pieces out of a sandy park and washed them off, and then I gave them to Luke to split evenly between Mark, Luke, and Priscilla and I. Before that Daria and I saw this strange demonstration at a mall where the people demonstrated how to take off clothing in a seductive manner. I found it fairly shocking because they did not wear underwear so after showing how to take off the dresses I saw their bushes. At the fashion demonstration I gave them two pairs of my pants to do demonstrations with and they complimented me saying they found me \"pretty hot and having a college degree\" they said this to Daria. It felt like all the ladies kept trying to seduce me, but I didn't have any of it. Both of my pants appeared pretty beat up and grass stained. Before that I remember staying at Sophie's house with her family, my family came there too. Somehow Caroline's family also seemed to have visited. Caroline's family spoke with very high diction and we felt condescended. My dad ended up watching a game between the Vikings and Packers. Sophie appeared to have a lot of adderall lying around her house that she would take sometimes. This transitioned to us going to some strange sort of wedding where I wore my purple checkered shirt and most everybody wore fancy clothing. Between a lot of this I somehow had time to play a game of something similar to Red Alert crossed with Starcraft and won. For my mission I attacked some sort of jail which let someone out, someone's uncle I think.\n\n2:06:01 PM: Also at some point I saw Mike Reiners wearing an ARML shirt that I didn't recognize and we talked about the good old days of ARML including the bright neon green ARML shirt. I think Matthias appeared there too. I don't remember how this fit in with the narrative of the rest of the dream.\n\n4:04:10 PM: Oh, I also remember that in my dream I mentioned to dad that Ronald Reagan read the Secret Teachings of All Ages by Manly P Hall. Clearly what I read before sleeping seeped through into my dream. \n\n#### Exercise\n\n7:11:46 AM: One slow OSPU on each side.\n\n#### Meditate\n\n8:26:57 AM: Interrupted today by Kitkat, but no big deal. Did feel like I concentrated on it fairly well today. I have started to get over the initial hump of tiredness it seems.\n\n4:32:31 PM: Meditated for 10 minutes with Federico. Just tried to do mindfulness of breath. Got crazy shifting phosphene visuals, mostly green and purple. Sat in full lotus, legs didn't feel too bad. Felt quite a few energy shivers.\n\n#### Plan Day\n\n8:28:18 AM: Today... what would I like to accomplish? I would like to wrap up loose ends at Sailthru. I should go to work early today because I have to leave at around 4:45 so that I can make it to the 5:15 private dojo class.\n\n#### Sailthru\n\n- [x] Get my Netsuite changes deployed. George just chatted me about that and it seems they will go out soon. I will actually release them myself.\n- [x] Deploy dev tools change.\n- [x] Deploy the recurring campaign scheduler change.\n- [x] Deploy PHP to ec2ev for Sam. And then let him know.\n- [x] Start patch backfill for case 8439. On pg3 in screen patch_stats\n- [] Look into list count failure that occurred on Jan 4th for ticket 10107. Need to write a script to find all the clients and lists that need recounting. Can use the day before and check each stats.list.day if the next day exists or not. Then we can use the stat_list_fudge_improved script to actually fix the lists once we have identified all of them.\n- [x] Handle 10193 for Satia. Got this running on pg3 in the screen \"big_ass_job\" still need to transfer over the file when it finishes.\n- [x] Reply to Kana on case 9480 about whether Java or PHP gives the correct results.\n- [x] Respond to Nazim on ticket 10100\n- [x] Fill out Brian May's worksheet on outstanding work.\n- [x] After the above, work on the query builder tickets I have assigned to me.\n- [x] Deploy bigmap to ec2ev for Sam.\n\n#### Taijutsu\n\n2:04:19 PM: Will go to class today. Would like to start a regular training regimen in the same way that I add practices. Basically, start with just doing tsuki each day, then add something, then add something, etc. until each day I practice many techniques.\n\n8:32:02 PM: Today felt pretty awesome. We worked on a variation of gansaaki nage, then we worked on muso dori. I finally seem to have learned some of the important points of muso, but I haven't figured out the ending yet. On the first movement I have finally started to connect the weight of my body dropping with my arm which forces the uke around. Then on the later part, I don't want to pull down with my lead hand, instead I just use it to keep his arm in the right alignment as I drop which stresses his shoulder.\n\n8:34:02 PM: Got lost on the way there... I really have to figure out and remember where building 2 exists.\n\n#### Journal\n\n11:26:26 AM: Very strange. After reading about how Solomon wished for wisdom from god, I said out loud that I wish to have no desire for any man or woman outside of my monogamous relationship. Then seemingly in answer I started shaking and felt joltings through my body.\n\n1:27:53 PM: Went to Ba'al with Matt G, Boris, and Eric. From what Matt G and Eric said it sounds like Danny will finally move to product, which I feel very happy for him about. He has wanted that for a long time, and he has waited for it. That gives me hope that I could actually end up on the data science team after a while. It seems that the managers and Brian and Ian have finalized the teams now, but nobody has announced them yet.\n\n4:02:11 PM: So far using this wiki to keep track of what I need to do seems effective to me. I have gotten a lot done today, despite how hectic it feels.\n\n11:03:42 PM: Helped Daria achieve a magnificent orgasm and she helped me do the same. We both felt really into it today, which I felt great about.\n\n11:04:50 PM: Overall I today gave me a feeling of confidence and success. I believe this wiki will continue to prove a very useful organizational tool, and because I will have a concrete record of my progress in it, it will help me advance to the outer reaches of my capacities. I believe occultists refer to this as the magic journal, and I will certainly make it even more magical as I add useful spells to it.\n\n11:08:57 PM: I decided that I will move taijutsu to the morning before Sailthru. Regardless of whether I have class later in the day, I believe I will enjoy practicing in the morning. And then after I feel physically satisfied from taijutsu and yoga and exercise, then I will meditate.\n\n#### TODO\n\n- [] Finish reading my hackny applicants.","title":"Mon Jan 06 2014","updated":{"$date":"2014-01-14T22:36:49.913Z"},"url":"1_6_2014"}

Kitkat listened to the lecture with me, and I helped scoot him up to a window so he could see out. I observed the coast through an old fashioned pirate telescope and saw a Taj Mahal looking building. Randall wanted to save an old hotel building, A Berke involved somehow. I asked Jordan about some of his porn habits with Jenn. I saw an app that told you every place where you had watched porn. Daria and I could form mental link in our dream, but she disconnected. When we woke up I tell her about it. I read a book about a girl who could never get captured or harmed despite everyone's lust for her because she acted so gentle and with the way that no one could bring themselves to harm her and thus she slipped away from them all. \n\n#### Yoga\n\n9:09:45 AM: Had class again with Fergus today.

I guess I won't really do anything just now. Anyway, I did get the day off to an acceptable start. Today I will practice my stealth meeting meditation since we will experience lots of time in meetings.","title":"Thu Jan 16 2014","updated":{"$date":"2014-01-17T03:29:35.298Z"},"url":"1_16_2014"}

Said some intriguing statements about having to do the inner working, possibly veiled references to the kundalini awakening? I feel that I have to feel with much greater sensitivity and integrate with my body in order to do taijutsu effectively. Or maybe I just need to train for twenty years. He said 20 years feel easy, the next 20 feel very difficult, after that one has forged the practice into something real. He mentioned that we must always return to the beginning.

I smoked pot with a young kid who climbed a building with me, then his mom got involved and we had a strange conversation about just how often the kid did smoke. He said once a day, she said six times a day, I figured 3 times a day based on the two. I did weird parkour all around this strange city. A weird TV series recommended to me by Jordan about guys in a virtual reality game falling in love with the female characters in the game. Partying with Daria and Randall. Jumping down a big platform with Mark while doing parkour. \n\n#### Yoga\n\n#### Meditate\n\n#### Plan Day\n\n- [x] Write today. Jesus story. Dasha Freud's transformation into goddess form.

We will meet tomorrow to practice since we've all cleared off tuesday nights on our schedules. \n\n10:46:11 PM: Practiced just standing in hicho, ichimonji, and ko-ichimonji for several minutes. Tried to work on getting my form correctly, and also feeling the energy during the forms and the transitions. Right now I mostly only feel energy during shizen, but the feeling has become very distinct and easy to recognize, and I can get it very rapidly. \n\n#### Projects\n\n#### Journal\n\n10:20:24 PM: I think that I ought to write more in my journal again. I really enjoyed reading The Three Stigmata, and I think I might read Ubik soon. PKD seems an interesting man. Writing in E-Prime feels easier now, but I still struggle with it in many contexts, especially at Sailthru. I would like to run everything I write through my wiki so that I can make sure to eliminate non E-Prime writing and thinking from my thought. I bought some Wilhelm Reich books, which I look forward to reading. Today has felt good. Daria and I cleaned up the apartment a bit. The stove looks really dirty, it would feel good to clean that too before David gets here. I expect him on Wednesday. Attending the seminar seems to have remotivated my practice, although I still haven't figured out exactly how taijutsu will help me help people. Perhaps by opening my observational skills and awareness. I've started to realize that to do taijutsu I have to really feel the presence of the people I train with. In that way due to the close proximity and true receptiveness to them, it has an almost erotic feeling to it. Which makes sense, because besides sex killing someone also feels very personal. Dr. Morris mentions that erotic quality of training and I didn't really understand it until now. Kacem looks very comfortable on the floor with his training partners, and I know he probably doesn't love men sexually given that I've seen his wife and she looks beautiful by conventional heterosexual standards. Anyway, I would like to keep up yoga and taijutsu both. I think I can grow into the strength and flexibility and receptiveness to do both. I feel like smoking marijuana because I feel a bit lonely that Daria hasn't come home yet. I feel very proud of giving her an amazing orgasm last night. Unfortunately we might not have time for sex tonight because she will get home past eleven I think, when we will need to sleep so that we can get up for yoga tomorrow. I suppose I shall just read until she gets home.  ","title":"Mon Jan 20 2014","updated":{"$date":"2014-01-21T03:47:08.790Z"},"url":"1_20_2014"}

I dreamed about a TV show Daria and I watched involving a dog that appeared in an early episode in a different form, the dog had to protect his owner from evil. I dreamed about a presidential race and the involvement of the president's daughter. I dreamed that I stayed at an apartment with dad and his friend a few stories up. Several tornados occurred, getting closer and closer to our building until one hit directly In the dream I partly recognized that the tornados came from sim city. We left the apartment in time to avoid our deaths. The structures of the building got severely damaged. We exited the building and surveyed the damage to the other buildings nearby. Then dad and I went back to the apartment we had stayed in. The wood structure lay in tatters. Dad acted very brave and jumped across huge gaps in the wood to the apartment, taking a board with him to try and repair it. But when he got to the former apartment everything drooped and he realized he would fall. He hung by one hand from a plank. I tried to reach out my foot for him to grab, and he jumped and tried to reach for it but fell at least two if not three stories flat on his back. I rushed down to see if he got hurt and he did. I tried calling 911 and dad yelled at me to do something. The 911 dispatchers didn't respond because so many people called, so I had to look up what to do and I felt panicked. \n\n#### Yoga\n\n8:42:46 AM: Very nice class with Fergus today. I made progress in crow's pose. I have to place the hands wide apart, and use chataranga arms.

We discussed the philosophy of uke and tsuki and he gave me some fine points to work on.

He told me that he has a suit of samurai armor in his family made of iridescent dragon scales. I told him I would like to see it one day. I dreamed I had three games of dungeon crawl or a similar game going in screen, I very distinctly remember that three of the screens said \"attached\". I had killed a very difficult rogue and he had a bunch of mundane items like shirts and gloves that had +6 enchantments. I met Daenerys Stormborn in a frozen tundra and desired to drink a little bit of her blood as a potion against the cold. I fought a very difficult dragon. I use all of my buffs at the start of the fight and got the dragon to very low health, at which point it fled. I chased it for a long time until my buffs ran out and he healed and then we resumed fighting. The dragon had very low health, and I had 10 hp and did not have any potions of heal wounds. I reached an impasse and didn't play for a while because I didn't know what to do next.  \n\n#### Yoga\n\n5:36:55 PM: Very nice yoga with Fergus today.

We visited my family and helped Mark and Luke pick up their rooms while playing with their toys. Mark and Dad got into an argument about when to do things, and Luke started to argue too because he felt he got worn down a bit. My parents expressed surprise at Luke doing that. I played a game Luke made involving blob people picking up different elemental powers and using them that resembled Vim at first but eventually became 3D and immersive. Daria and I played together and we got to the new area we went back to gather our party. I fixed some sort of battery powered device by reassembling it.

Chris Chapman and Ann happened to stay at the Hotel. At the hotel. which seemed located in Taiwan and or New York they gave you free rice and beans in sand that people could make into balls to eat.

Perhaps it could work for you too. I find the concept simple: I have trouble taking actions that feel unjustified to me. So I need to connect every action I take to a reason. I find love a very powerful reason and motivator. Thus I have created the mantra, _Do it Now, Out of Love_. \n\nThe mantra reminds me of two important facts. First, anything I want to do has a higher probability of reaching fruition if I start it now, rather than later. In the gap between now and later a million catastrophes could strike. I could fall into a rift between universes, get struck by lighting, or change my mind and decide I don't want to do it. So if I _really_ want it done, I do it now. \n\nSecond, anything I will enjoy doing, I do out of love. It seems to me that only love can motivate me to get shit done. I have always procrastinated and slacked off on my own homework, but should a group assignment occur I rise to the occasion. I always felt more willing to help someone else with their homework than do my own. \n\nTo connect to the second point, I have crafted a template for the todo items I create on this wiki. The template goes like this:\n\n- () I will _do something I want to do_ because I love _someone I love_\n\nThis template fills out for me whenever I hit ctrl-z and I find it super convenient and useful. For example, some of my Sailthru todos look like this:\n\n- (♥) I will fix _Horizon Interest function 9985_ because I love my team.\n- (♥) I will finish _10826: (Support) Java Snapshot: \"Viewed Page\" criteria returns 0 results_ because I love Johnson. \n\nAnd some of my personal todos look like:\n\n- (♥) I will buy Broadway tickets because I love Daria.\n- (♥) I will write about Do it Now, Out of Love because I love my friends and family.\n\nYou can also read about why I chose the word [will](will).","title":"Do it Now, Out of Love","updated":{"$date":"2014-02-04T04:22:58.514Z"},"url":"do_it_now_out_of_love"}

She mentioned the idea of moving back to North Carolina until school starts, which I would find awful. I would consider that effectively breaking up with me. I really hoped that she would take her year off to really consider what she wants to do with her life and figure out what makes her happy. I regret that she has thrown herself into this job at Thinkful which doesn't appear to make her happy in the slightest. \n\n11:41:23 AM: Well, today has turned out pretty nice. I won an admiral award thanks to Federico, and he gave me some bitcoin too. YellowSubmarine got a lot of accolades, which I find awesome. I think that we will get things off to a great start this year. \n\n6:15:31 PM: Another great meeting with Chris. I really like him and hope we continue to collaborate in the future.

I feel incredibly grateful working as part of our team. However, I find myself questioning what I do while I at the office. When I met you, I mentioned that I took this year off from Columbia to become a better programmer.  I want to become a better software engineer, not just a better web developer. \n\nI spend the bulk of my time at Thinkful working on front-end projects. But I feel most excited about the prospect of working in AngularJS and Python+Flask. I think I have a strong grasp of HTML/CSS/jQuery but not necessarily AngularJS, and I haven't worked enough with our backend. \n\nI realize that you may feel I lack the skills to tackle problems in Python currently. To address this problem, I would like to propose that I spend about 40% of my time at Thinkful working through the Python course. If I devote two days a week, plus time on the weekend, I could finish the course in a month and a half. During this time, I would still work on front-end projects, and by the summer, I will be prepared to transition to working in Python. \n\nThanks for reading, and let me know what you think,\nDaria","title":"Tue Feb 04 2014","updated":{"$date":"2014-02-05T01:38:42.618Z"},"url":"2_4_2014"}

I practiced taijutsu to take breaks from programming. I got a phone call from a lady about speaking about my programming experience at a taijutsu seminar. I acted as some kind of secret operative dropped off in eastern europe, I tried to kill some guys by stabbing them in the throat but they survived because I only had a little skewer as a weapon so I ran away. I met an undercover American agent there who seemed my contact for escaping. I thought I had to kill him but he convinced me that in fact I had to trust him as my only way out. We escaped the warlords together. We rented a few rooms in a house together that seemed a lot like Hightower, but even bigger with more rooms.

Other startups and tech companies do a FAR better job of marketing themselves towards developers. We can do better than \"In the past year, our staff has more than doubled.\"  I don't find that a compelling reason to work somewhere as a developer.\n\nWhen a recruiter contacts me, I immediately look the company up. In Palantir's case their website persuaded me to go through their interview process.

At companies where my friends work like Etsy, Meetup, Palantir, etc. the engineers work with marketing and recruiting to build webpages that appeal to developers. You can't write about how it feels to work as a developer here, only we can, so I apologize for not helping you with that earlier. You might also find it difficult to code new pages on the site, but we find that fairly simple.\n\nGive the dev team the freedom to build a better Careers page and we'll do it for you. I have attended a lot of hackathons and recruiting events for Sailthru now and I still feel astounded at how frustrated I sometimes get trying and recruit and sell people on Sailthru. However I feel confident that we can change that for you.\n\nA very talented friend of mine and Danny Rosen's who currently works at Thinkful feels curious about Sailthru but has had to reach out to us individually to ask us about working at Sailthru.

I like to imagine that if my life was a painting, hanging in a gallery, then it is sitting in a nice frame. What comes before and after my life is the frame. Since I’m just the painter, and I’m not the museum curator, I don’t have any actual control over the frame, but I like to think about what frames might be aesthetically pleasing with the picture I’m painting.\n\n----\n\nOut of chaos and mysterious physical law, consciousness arises seemingly ex-nihilo. Is there a purpose to life beyond fulfilling our genetic imperatives? This is not in the realm of science to answer.\n\n----\n\nBefore I was, there was nothing. After I am, there is nothing.\n\n----\n\nThis “life” that I’m experiencing is merely my vacation. In subjective time it may feel like some ninety plus years, but in real time it takes place in three days, whereupon I must resume my job at Amalgamated Axion Corporation where I work as a mid-level software engineer developing virtual reality software.\n\n----\n\nThis “life” that I’m experiencing is part of a game that all nine billion plus humans aboard the Starship Hermetica play to pass time while we fly to Proxima Centauri without the benefit of faster than light travel. It is the hope of our scientists and sociologists that by continually replaying stages of human development we can discover more effective forms of government and prevent our next home from undergoing catastrophe.\n\n----\n\nThis universe exists as a simulation inside of another universe. That universe too is a simulation. The “universe” as we can conceive of it is a line stretching into infinity on both ends of simulations inside simulations. Or perhaps, the worm of simulations bites its own tail, and we live in a loop of simulations.\n\n----\n\nWhen I was conceived, the Christian God created my consciousness out of his own divine spark. When I die, if I have repented and lived my life righteously I will ascend to heaven, otherwise I will descend into hell with the other sinners.\n\n----\n\nThe Christian God is a Programmer who was lonely being the only being. So she created other consciousnesses. However, she had a dilemma. It would be boring if everyone was the same. So she created great variety and individuation between people.

,{"_id":"ecpRXpMhTCLKTmcLC","active":true,"name":"0","prose":"CDSxfNzwFNpvzAZsH","text":"Dear Matthew,\n\nThe best kind of practice is practice you can do constantly! You know this about meditation. Nothing like doing some quick practice while sitting in the subway. You are in luck, because a lot of these practices build off of the foundation you've lain with meditation.\n\n#### 1. Internal sense of time\n\nHere's how you practice. Think what time you think it is. Check your watch. Record how much you were off by. Keep doing this until you are very accurate. Here's to knowing what time it is without looking! When would this be useful? Well, it can be rude to check your watch during a conversation. Instead, just know when you have to leave!\n\n#### 2. Internal sense of direction\n\nThink about where you think north is. Check where north is. Record how much you were off by. Keep doing this until you are very accurate. This is actually very easy to do using the military time system. Always keep track of rotations on the clock. Why would this be useful? Because having to glance down at a smart phone to navigate is silly. Also hard to do while sprinting. Much better to just always know where you are headed.\n\n#### 3. Sight\n\nYes, seeing is a skill. A more and more neglected one, too, as people tend to spend all their time staring into screens. Practice being aware of the entire field of vision at once. Especially concentrate on getting both edges of the peripheral vision at once. A great place to practice this is on the subway, when sitting sideways in the middle of the car. Try to see every movement everyone makes on both sides. This way you will notice more. Being able to see \"sideways\" also lets you covertly observe people when doing intense people watching for character studies. There's never a need to stare at someone unless you want their attention. Whenever you are reading, push the text slightly out of your optimal range and let your eyes strain slightly to refocus. This is training the eyes to see further. It's a gradual process, just like ruining your eyes by training them to see shorter was.\n\n#### 4. Hearing\n\nHearing too is a skill. Listen to music on the lowest volume setting possible. Practice hearing all 360 degrees around you, and at every distance you are able. Try to extend the edge of your hearing radius. The quieter you are, the better you can hear, as there is no signal interference. You've mastered the silent breath and sitting still through meditation, now see how far you can extend the hearing radius when you really focus on it.\n\n#### 5. Feeling\n\nTo master ninjitsu and other physical skills it is necessary to maintain full body awareness. Seek out muscles, internal organs, and patches of skin that are normally tuned out and integrate them into normal awareness. When you make any movement you should feel every part of the body as the movement happens. You are already pretty good at pinpointing and maintaining body awareness through meditation, now you have to make it the default state. You should always feel your clothing and hair on you, until they feel like extensions of your body. That's what hair is, sensory extension cables that happens to pick up very fine vibrations. Feel variations of air pressure on the skin.\n\n#### 6. Smelling\n\nUnfortunately for humans our olfactory nerve bundle is very limited, but you probably haven't been practicing how to smell very effectively. You actually have a pretty sensitive nose, which is why you spend most of the time ignoring smells. That's a waste, though, you are just throwing away information. You've been told a lot of things smell bad, when they really don't. They just smell unusual. People are a prime example. People don't smell bad, they all just smell unusual. In fact, scent is a prime signal of sexual compatibility. You want to be with someone who smells good to you. Most people don't realize this, but you will continue to as you use your nose: people smell different depending on their emotional state. Happy, confident, relaxed smells good, whereas stressed and angry do not smell good. Smells also tell you a lot about what a person eats, though you have a lot more experimentation to do before you can start to draw conclusions here.\n\n#### 7. Integration\n\nWhen you first started out, you could really only engage one sense fully at a time. Now you have progressed to the point where you can perform panoramic vision and hearing at once. This gives you great situational awareness. However, the goal is really to integrate every sense, and make that the default state of awareness. This way if three people attacked you (one from behind) due to the combination of seeing and hearing you would have a model of where each was (unless the one from behind walked very quietly) and, because you have maintained body awareness during this, can respond effectively.\n\n#### 8. Doing things silently\n\nEverything can be done stealthily. Noise is lost mechanical energy due to inefficiency. You should practice doing everything you do as quietly as possible, because not only will you be stealthy, you'll save yourself effort by doing it the most efficient way. You love to minimize waste, and every sound you make with a footstep is wasted energy. Walking in absolute silence is amazing, because it is a full body work out. That's why it is hard at first, a lot of your muscles had been neglected and underused from doing things the inefficient way. Think about how strong your psoas, arch, and calves have gotten since you started walking silently.\n\n#### 9. Feeling X for no reason\n\nYou don't need a reason to feel happy. You can feel happy just because you want to. Since discovering meditation, you've got to wonder, why should you need a reason to be happy? Just be happy all the time. You are getting pretty good at this when you remember to do it, but you've got to practice until it is a default. You know how to trigger the brain into happiness.\n\nYou should make joy into a default. And make confidence a default. And make relaxation a default. And make curiosity a default. Really, just make yourself into a maelstrom of magnanimity, a pulsar of positivity. There's no reason not to.\n\n#### 10. Shifting perspectives\n\nIn the course of observing something if you can find how it is tragic, how it is humorous, how it is mundane, how it is extraordinary.\n\nWhenever you meet someone, try to enter their mind as best you can. Observe their posture, manner and mirror it. Listen to them. There is so much information in a person's voice. Listen to the modulation, the timbre, the volume, the pitch, the rhythm, the phrasing, the style, the usage. A person can tell you so much more than they think they can. Match your communication. People love it when you are ‘on their wave length’ so to speak. This is excellent practice for play acting, pretending, mimicry, identity swapping, and other fun games that can be played with our ‘personalities’ or masks.\n\nAll of this allows you to view a situation from many perspectives, a generally useful cognitive ability. Sometimes the solution is obvious with the right view point. Sometimes you need to understand something from a friend’s perspective so you can comfort them appropriately.\n\n#### 11. Memory\n\nMemory palaces, peg systems, mnemonic systems. These all exist in your head, so of course you can practice them anywhere.\n\n#### 12. Strength \u0026 Balance\n\nYeah, strength is a skill. These are super easy to train. Take every opportunity to stand on one bent leg. Opportunities to practice strength are very plentiful. You can do a pistol or one armed push-up anywhere.","updated":{"$date":"2013-11-29T17:25:35.373Z"},"url":"practice_portable_skills"}

Dad held an intervention for me because I didn't get a high enough subject test score for multivariable calculus on some sort of standardized test, so he brought a bunch of people over that homeschooled to come talk to me about how I should use this one particular text book to prepare for the test, but they all brought their young children and it felt too awkward for dad to really even bring up what he wanted the meeting to really discuss and we just ended up awkwardly watching television and then adjourning. Not everyone had a chair so I ended up standing to make room for everyone else, and then sitting at the opposite end of the room. The meeting took place in a really chilly basement of a strange house. The house apparently belonged to like Aditya's godmother and it had a huge turtle that looked and acted aggressive like an alligator that chased me around a bit while Daria and dad restrained it finally and I saw a lot of other exotic and less exotic pets around. Before or after that somehow I lived with this family and since I didn't want to mooch from them during the meal times I went to this Chinese buffet and would load up a plate with food and then run out, because it a really weird structure. While I wandered the restaurant I saw mom's brother Noah there, who took me downstairs. This might actually lead up to the part before, I confused the chronology here a bit. So the restaurant basement may have morphed into the weird house. I think the transition occurred like this: we watched the television and Louis CK brought a bunch of girls on his show in the audience and did a thing where they all called his cellphone at once, which in the dream made it ring super load instead of just ringing once. And they all looked cute and young, so the men in the audience felt jealous or something. And then they all left the show. And then inexplicably we followed the life of one of the girls from a third person vantage as she went around tagging tons of stuff with graffiti and narrowly avoided getting caught several times. She tagged a huge grain elevator like the ones in Minneapolis the most, but someone wanted to tear it down. I think a lot of the dream took place there. Yeah, the same place where the dream started. So then I went to go back into it with Daria and Priscilla, because they apparently know this place super well, and I know it a bit less well, and they walked through it really fast which made me feel scared me a bit because it looked dark and they kind of leave me behind at certain points. I remember at an earlier point during the dream running out of the basement with a group of people, including the graffiti girl, I think, and out of the building.\n\n2:12:22 PM: Had some nice conversation with Daria today about the future of our relationship. I felt relieved that I could tell her sometimes a part of me tells me that I should see other women, but most of me feels romantic and just wants her.\n\n2:15:08 PM: I had a great time yesterday. The little indian restaurant we went to seemed a bit insane, and the indian store had lots of awesome stuff in it. I loved seeing Steve and getting to hang out with him.\n\n2:26:34 AM: Had a great time with Steve and Randall and Daria at the Uncommons game cafe. Also had a great lunch with David Dalrymple and Randall and Daria at Hanjoo. David will probably go to hacker school and may live with me. He ran out of money to do nemaload, but now he will work on mesh. He also worked on a project called labortorium in san francisco. I won in settlers of catan today employing the tit for tat strategy and I think it worked. I like winning games but not at the expense of my values. I will play games in order to express myself and not to win. I think that will be a fun way to play. Watch me cast a spell here. Play is expression.\n\n2:35:06 AM: yijing today gave me 23. Splitting Apart. Mountain over fire.Huge synchronicity since this features prominently in the illuminatus trilogy which I have read the last few days. Haven't finished it yet. It looked ominous at first, but I got a sixth in the fifth place. I think it indicates to me what I must do at sailthru and rally myself behind a strong leader. It cautions me against trying to take control, because I do not have a strong foundation to work on right now. Therefore in this interpretation I take the position of the weak principle that yields to the strong, and we both profit. Also splitting apart represents the acquiescence of my psyche to philosopher-queen aliza. \n\n2:39:00 AM: The yijing next lead to 20. Contemplation (view). \"It means both contemplation and visibility, in the sense of people viewing you as an example\". Wind over earth, the image resembles a tower. The tower where Aliza keeps her headquarters, the center of my breath. I feel this resembles a powerful portent. If I can build a solid base through my contemplation people will see me as an example and I will gain influence. \"Thus a hidden spiritual power emanates from them, influencing and dominating others without their detection of how it happens.\"\n\n2:46:00 AM: Matt Wetmore raised a great point today when he came over to the apartment.

If I want to go through with this, I suppose I must deal with the disapproval. For myself, Art. Accurate, as I seek to combine elements into a new alchemical arrangement. For the current environment, The Star, I do find the environment seems hopeful. Perhaps that represents Ann's hopes too, as based on her body language she does find me attractive. For the obstacle, The Heirophant. I interpret that to mean that religion obstructs me, due to the monogamous beliefs we have all three brought up with. For the goal, 6 of Wands (Victory). Foundation of the current environment: 7 of Wands. The past, Ace of Disks, interesting as it seems I have already accomplished the material goals I set out to in my previous reading. Useful confirmation as I think I have established my value at Sailthru. Immediate future, princess of swords. Seen a lot of her lately. Still suspect that she represents Kristie, curious what role she has to play. The future environment: knight of wands. Not sure what to make of that, except that there sure does appear a lot of fire in this reading. Twice now I get the Nine of Swords in the position of society. The challenge: 5 of Wands, strife. Seems if I want to go down this path, it will lead to some strife. I did expect that. Fortunately, the outcome, 4 of Wands, Completion. \" Completion. Settlement. Arrangement completed. Perfected work. A completion of a thing built up with trouble and labor. Rest after labor. Subtlety, cleverness, mirth, beauty, success in completion.\" A good ending if I can carry through.

He frequently overrules Studs, who I believe acts as the actual product owner, when we try to move the discussion forward. What do our discussion get stuck on? Catching up Brian on the current state of our system, the past state of our system, architectural decisions, etc. \n\nHe asks a lot of questions and expects answers. I think people should feel encouraged to ask questions, but not every question requires a detailed fifteen minute discussion so that a single person can feel satisfied. Frequently we have to answer questions that ONLY Brian doesn't know the answer to. Each time we spend fifteen minutes answering a single person's question we waste Num_of_people_in_room * 15 minutes. The person-hours really pile on. \n\nI don't feel comfortable telling Brian that he should have that discussion elsewhere. He likes to frame his questions as crucial to the continuation of the process and since he always takes the role of \"moderator\" has no hesitation to grind a meeting to a halt until we answer his question and he allows us to move forward. \n\nI don't think this constitutes an agile process. And while I respect Brian might intend to guide us towards an Agile process, I don't think that works. I think we have to learn Agile ourselves, make our own mistakes. We should iterate on our own process, based on our own feedback. I think left alone we will actually hold ourselves to an even higher standard than Brian can hold us to, because we will push ourselves. I know everyone on my team feels a need to excel, and I think the best way to accomplish will involve getting out of the way. \n\nThank you for your time and consideration.","name":"7","updated":{"$date":"2014-02-20T02:34:42.042Z"},"_id":"4KdbuEWzNyDayJSDi"}

Literally a house built into a tree. I visited Hanzhe Gao and we smoked a bong together, we expected other people to show up but we ended up smoking together alone. Then we drove to that tree house? Along the way I played some video games with Mark that he looked really good at. Some kind of shootemup. Alyxa wanted to have sex with me, but I don't know where that fits into the narrative. \n\n#### Journal\n- () I love understanding my body so I will attend yoga class at 7:30.\n\n- () I love starting the day right so I will practice meditation when I get back from yoga.\n\n- () I love knowing what I need to do so I will plan my day after I meditate and before I go to Sailthru. \n\n- () I love staying relaxed at work so I will practice strength and balance using the kettlebell at Sailthru.\n\n- () I love protecting myself and others so I will practice taijutsu when I get back from Sailthru.\n\n- () I love expanding my mind so I will read a book before bed.\n\n_Why did you choose to work at Sailthru instead of any other company you interviewed with?_\n\nSailthru welcomed me with open arms to the wonders of NYC. I felt really at home with everyone I met. I felt a vibe that people had big ideas but remained down to earth.\n\n_What motivates you to work within the tech industry in general, and how does Sailthru satisfy that passion?_\n\nI've always felt an obsession for solving problems. I used to compete in math tournaments to get my fix. When I grew up I started sharpening my problem solving skills on computers and since then I've found that scaling start-ups involves intricate and challenging problems of a caliber I haven't seen elsewhere. \n\n_What does \"Think Big\" mean at Sailthru? Why is this important?_\n\nTo me 'Think Big' means I should look at the big picture, think about long term solutions. That I should think so big that like the hulk I erupt out of the box. It emphasizes that my job involves thinking. I don't work here because I want someone to tell me what to do. I want to figure out what I need to do and how it'll help the company at large.\n\n_What does \"Speak Up\" mean at Sailthru? Why is this important?_\n\nTo me 'Speak Up' means a lot. It means that I ask for help when I need it. It means that when I see a problem I don't keep it to myself. It means that we encourage open communication, that communication doesn't occur in a single direction from the top down. It means that I have just as much right as any exec to engender open discussions. It also means that we listen. When I hear about a problem, I work to fix it.\n\n_What does \"Get It Done\" mean at Sailthru? Why is this important?_\n\nTo me 'Get It Done' has several connotations. It encompasses the phrase 'better to ask forgiveness than permission'. I feel no fear to fail at Sailthru, we do not punish failure, rather we see it as a valuable part of an iterative process of improvement. We try to minimize the barriers in the way of working. People here do not seek permission to fix a problem. As soon as they hear about one, it gets done. 'Get It Done' means that people trust me to exercise my judgment and don't second guess and put arduous approval processes in the way.\n\n_Sailthru values transparency in everything it does. How has this benefited yourself, your team, and/or the company as a whole?_\n\nI have benefited from having the ability to investigate a problem and get the whole picture. What I need to know doesn't get hidden from me for arbitrary business reasons. My team benefits from knowing what happens in the rest of business. By keeping abreast of what the other departments need we can guide our own decision process to maximize mutual benefit. That in turn benefits the business immensely. \n\n_Why are our All Hands meetings valuable? Why are they unique?_\n\n_What does Sailthru allow you to do that no other company has before?_\n\nTake matters into my own hands, set my own schedule and organize my life so that I can work most effectively with the least burnout. Generally make me feel trusted to make the right decisions for everyone's benefit.\n\n_What makes you leave at the end of the day feeling satisfied with your work?_\n\nKnowing I've stretched my abilities as a software developer, that I had another fun day working with my friends, that tomorrow I've still got plenty to do. Knowing that I chose what I did today and I will choose what I do tomorrow.\n\n_How does Sailthru challenge you to be better?_\n\nSailthru challenges me to grow as fast as Sailthru has grown. In a time I find shockingly short I've had to come to terms with new technologies, new scaling challenges, and new ways to manage my time. \n\n_When have you felt supported while working at Sailthru?_\n\nAll the time. I know that if I really mess up everyone will come catch me and help me clean up the problem. I know that I can draw on people for help and they welcome the opportunity to help. I have received mentoring and learned so much here as a result of people's openness. \n\n_When have you felt trusted while working at Sailthru?_\n\nAll the time. Sailthru has handed me the keys to its digital kingdom and placed enormous responsibility in my hands. The amount of power I wield as a result of my work as a developer feels staggering at times. Everyone trusts me not to screw up, and that if I do I will fix it. \n\n_In what ways is Sailthru encouraging of progressive and out-of-the-box thinking?_\n\nThrough the mantra and supportive atmosphere.\n\n_How does Sailthru approach failure?_\n\nSailthru sees failures as blessings in disguise. We always look for the lesson rather than assigning blame and we expect a regular amount of failure as a normal part of an iterative process of improvement. If we didn't make mistakes that would imply we've stopped trying to improve.\n\n_How has Sailthru encouraged you to work collaboratively?_\n\nBy putting me in a room with supremely talented people that I can learn from and want to work with.\n\n_If you could describe your coworkers in just a few words, what would you say?_\n\nDriven, charismatic, open, courageous, efficient.\n\n9:30:22 PM: Feel lonely... miss Daria already hah. Not sure what I want to do tonight. Perhaps prepare more intensely for my up coming trip. I suppose I should train taijutsu right now. A good opportunity. Still sad that I can't express myself to Ann, but I can't deny that I have a real connection with Daria. ","updated":{"$date":"2014-02-21T02:31:35.108Z"},"url":"2_20_2014"}

,{"_id":"bNs7LtePoeKJPy9gs","active":true,"name":"2","prose":"8q9zBcnXcGYW3occc","text":"Precious Friend,\n\nPrepare yourself for this experience by feeling well rested. You may find the experience rather tiring and thus more enjoyable if you feel fresh at the outset. The experience will take all day so arrange to feel absolutely free of any and all commitments on your time or attention for the entire day. I find the closing stages of the experience often very valuable and you will not likely wish to break up the session until late in the evening.\n\nBetween now and the exploration session I would like you to think over what you consider your main problems. If you have any questions about these to which you would like to find the answers write the questions down in a list. You will find that during the drug experience you may find it very worthwhile to check the list over because then you will likely find the answers.\n\nA day or two after the exploration we will want you to write an account of your experience. This will help you by making it easier to remember later on.\n\nYou will notice certain physical symptoms and rather peculiar feelings particularly at the beginning. How you react to these will prove important. You can make them either pleasant and enjoyable or, if you let yourself become alarmed by them, you can make them unpleasant and painful.\n\nYou can ensure that they feel pleasant by simply relaxing and enjoying them. For example, you may feel your body becoming weightless. Accept such changes and enjoy them as novel sensations for they will offer you a chance to explore new areas of experience. If you fight against them you not only make them disturbing to yourself but tend to lessen the benefit you can hope to gain through this exploration.\n\nYou will find this true of all aspects of the experience which you will experience. Accept what happens and how you feel with as little questioning as you can. Later, after the experience, you will have ample time to think about it and you will recall what you felt and thought. During the exploration itself remember to relax and enjoy the feelings, thoughts, images and sensations for themselves. If during the experience you try to make everything fit into your everyday experience you will cheat yourself both of the good effects of the drug and the pleasure you can find.\n\nAt times during the experience you may feel like laughing or crying and you should not try to hold back these expressions of feeling. Nearly everyone who takes the drug finds they feek moved to laughter and to tears several times during the experience. Actually these feelings will bother you less if you accept them as a normal part of the experience and do not try to fight against them.\n\nThe day will feel quite informal and we will listen to music, talk about various things, read, look at pictures and so forth. The drug makes music more enjoyable and increases your appreciation of pictures. If you have music you would particularly like to hear or pictures you would like to look at please bring them along. Photographs look very interesting since one seems to understand the pictured people very well and often becomes aware of new aspects of their personalities. \n\nIn my experience I find it unlikely that you will feel much like eating during the day but we will have plenty of fruit, chocolate and fruit juice on hand.\n\nThe physical symptoms tend to fade away after several hours. However, if you begin to question the reality of the experience or to become dissatisfied with the experience or with yourself or with me or with other people, the experience may become confusing and unpleasant or you may find yourself growing extremely suspicious and afraid. At these times some of the unpleasant physical feelings may return.\n\nDuring the experience we must trust each other. If you find things becoming unpleasant simply concentrate on the bond of trust and understanding between us and you will find that the unpleasant aspects of the experience will fade away.\n\nMany hours after you take the drug you will feel that the drug effects have largely gone and that the experience has ended. Actually you have adjusted to the drug and during this period we can exchange ideas with remarkable ease.\n\nAfter about 9 hours the psychological symptoms will all have gone with the possible exception of a slight difficulty in judging distances which may last into the following day. You will most probably feel as though you had gone for some time without sleep and had arrived at the state in which you no longer feel sleepy. You will probably feel physically tired but mentally clear and alert.\n\nAt about this time we will have a good meal after which we will discuss matters until we feel we would like to end the session.\n\nI know that you can find this a very valuable experience. I believe you will find nothing concerning about it from the point of view of your health and mental health. Thousands of people have taken it without any ill effects while nearly all of them have found its effects remarkable and wonderful.\n\nThe important things to remember:\n\nDuring the experience accept the novel feelings as real and true. You can question them and apply the usual forms of logic to them at your leisure in the days that follow but for the few hours that the drug has effect simply accept and enjoy them.\n\nTo the extent that you trust yourself and trust me the experience will feel pleasant and our understanding and fellowship will feel very close. To the extent that you grow suspicious and withdraw the experience becomes unpleasant and confusing. In this experience you control your own feelings and you can stop the development of these unpleasant aspects by simply concentrating on the level of trust we can have in each other and the bond of affection and understanding which the experience can generate.","updated":{"$date":"2014-02-27T18:07:11.870Z"},"url":"trip_prep"}

Or they can spend weeks learning the context on which they must base their decisions. In the time it takes them to learn the context they won't lead, and the developers will lose respect for them. The new Director needs to come out of the gates running.\n* That person needs to earn our respect. Someone brought in from outside has to work extremely hard for that, and walk a fine line between gaining our trust and exerting his authority. The development team would find it much easier to respect someone who has fought in the trenches with them, and understands the PAIN of on-duty.\n* That person needs to know our code. Anyone who doesn't understand just how much technical debt and exactly what technical debt we have can't make meaningful decisions about our code. I doubt a director we hire from outside will have lots of time read all our code when we pack their schedules full of meetings.\n\nI think that Brian had the best of intentions and that he had scathes of relevant experience he could share with us, but for the reasons above he couldn't help us as effectively as he would have liked. This problem doesn't have to do with Brian. Anyone we bring in from outside will have the above points apply to them and encounter the same difficulties.\n\nI think that you should promote George Liao to as act as Director of Development. If not permanently, at least in the interim. Allow me to enumerate the numerous benefits you would see from this promotion.\n\n* George already has universal admiration within the development team.

Keeping in mind that he only started studying the backend code recently. \n* Right now among developers a sentiment exists that you don't know people's true value. Otherwise how could you place Melissa and Nazim on the same level as George? Promoting George would demonstrate that you reward loyalty. It would show people that a career path does exist at Sailthru, that we promote our own. \n* George listens very well. And he understands what he hears because he actually possesses the knowledge necessary to listen to a developer on technical issues. I feel like he can actually relate to me because he has experienced everything a developer here can experience. \n\nI think George can lead. On the HAL team I witnessed that he acts as a natural leader. A leader that I want to follow, because he doesn't put himself first. Out of anybody I know he embodies the idea of putting the team first. I believe our dev team would feel inspired by his leadership and that he has what it takes to make bold decisions without alienating developers. \n\nThank you for reading and please have an excellent day.","updated":{"$date":"2014-02-27T19:04:12.713Z"},"url":"2_27_2014"}

,{"_id":"Pqbbq3Aza2AQ5nvK4","active":true,"name":"0","prose":"gQQ2MRtch9kN96TsD","text":"## Introduction\n\n    Naturalness is called the Way.\n    The Way has no name or form;\n    it is just the essence\n    just the primal spirit.\n\n_The Secret of the Golden Flower_ is a lay manual of Buddhist and Taoist methods for clarifying the mind. A distillation of the inner psychoactive elements in ancient spiritual classics, it describes a natural way to mental freedom practiced in China for many centuries.\n\nThe golden flower symbolizes the quintessence of the paths of Buddhism and Taoism. Gold stands for light, the light of the mind itself; the flower represents the blossoming, or opening up, of the light of the mind. Thus the expression is emblematic of the basic awakening of the real self and its hidden potential.\n\nIn Taoist terms, the first goal of the Way is to restore the original God-given spirit and become a self-realized human being. In Buddhist terms, a realized human being is someone conscious of the original mind, or the real self, as it is in its spontaneous natural state, independent of environmental conditioning.\n\nThis original spirit is also called the celestial mind, or the natural mind. A mode of awareness subtler and more direct than thought or imagination, it is central to the blossoming of the mind. _The Secret of the Golden Flower_ is devoted to the recovery and refinement of the original spirit.\n\nThis manual contains a number of helpful meditation techniques, but its central method is deeper than a form of meditation. Using neither idea nor image, it is a process of getting right to the root source of awareness itself. The aim of this exercise is to free the mind from arbitrary and unnecessary limitations imposed upon it by habitual fixation on its own contents. With this liberation, Taoists say, the conscious individual becomes a \"partner of creation\" rather than a prisoner of creation.\n\nThe experience of the blossoming of the golden flower is likened to light in the sky, a sky of awareness vaster than images, thoughts, and feelings, and unimpeded space containing everything without being filled. This it opens up an avenue to an endless source of intuition, creativity, and inspiration. Once this power of mental awakening has been developed, it can be renewed and deepened without limit.\n\nThe essential practice of the golden flower requires no apparatus, no philosophical or religious dogma, no special paraphernalia or ritual. It is practiced in the course of daily life. It is near at hand, being in the mind itself, yet it involves no imagery or thought. It is remote only in the sense that it is a use of of attention generally unfamiliar to the mind habituated to imagination and thinking. \n\n_The Secret of the Golden Flower_ is remarkable for the sharpness of its focus on a very direct method for self-realization accessible to ordinary lay people. When it was written down in a crisis more than two hundred years ago, it was a concentrated revival of an ancient teaching; and it has been periodically revived in crises since, due to the rapidity with which the method can awaken awareness of hidden resources in the mind.\n\n_The Secret of the Golden Flower_ is the first book of its kind to have been translated into a Western language. A German version by Richard Wilhelm was first published in 1929, and an English translation of this German rendition was published shortly thereafter. Both German and English editions included an extensive commentary by the distinguished psychologist C. G. Jung, whose work became a major influence in Western psychology, studies of mythology and religion, and New Age culture in general.\n\nAlthough Jung credited _The Secret of the Golden Flower_ with having clarified his own work on the unconscious, he maintained serious reservations about the practice taught in the book. What Jung did not know was that the text he was reading was in fact a garbled translation of a truncated version of a corrupted recension of the original work.\n\nUnawares, a critical communication gap occurred in the process of transmission; and yet the book made a powerful impression. It became one of the main sources of Western knowledge of Eastern spirituality and also one of the seminal influences in Jungian thought on the psychology of religion. Cary F. Baynes, who rendered Wilhelm's German into English, even went so far as to hail it as \"the secret of the power of growth latent in the psyche.\"\n\nPsychological and experiential approaches to religion have enriched modern psychological thought and research which have in turn enriched the understanding and experience of religion. In terms of religion as culture, one of the advantages of a psychological approach is the facility with which emotional boundaries of church and sect can thereby be transcended.\n\nIn Wilhelm's own introduction to his translation of _The Secret of the Golden Flower_, he notes that Taoist organizations following this teaching in his time included not only Confucians and Buddhists but also Jews, Christians, and Muslims, all without requiring them to break way from their own religious congregations. So fundamental is the golden flower awakening that it brings out inner dimensions in all religions.\n\nFrom the point of view of that central experience, it makes no more difference whether one calls the golden flower awakening a relationship to God or to the Way, or whether one calls it the holy spirit or the Buddha nature or the real self. The _Tao Te Ching_ says, \"Names can be designated, but they are not fixed terms.\"\n\nThe image of the opening up of the golden flower of the light in the mind is used as but one of many ways of alluding to an effect that is really ineffable. The pragmatic purpose of Taoist and Buddhist teachings is to elicit experience, not to inculcate doctrines; that is why people of other religions, or with no religion at all, have been able to aail themselves of the psychoactive technologies of Taoism and Buddhism without destroying their own cultural identities. \n\nConsidered in terms of its essential aim rather the forms it can take, the golden flower method can be used to transcend the barriers of personal and cultural differences without losing the richness of diversity and distinction. \n\n_The Secret of the Golden Flower_ is indeed a powerful treatise on awakening the hidden potential of a universal human being, and it is in reality an even better and more useful book than Wilhelm, Jung, or Baynes thought it to be. However immature his rendition may have been, I am deeply indebted to Richard Wilhelm for introducing this extraordinary text to the West, for it could otherwise have gone unnoticed for decades, even centuries, amidst the hundreds upon hundreds of Taoist and Buddhist treatises awaiting translation. \n\nIt can therefore be said that it is because of Wilhelm's efforts that this new English version of _The Secret of the Golden Flower_ has come into being. it is to further inquiries into ways of approaching universal psychology and mental wholeness in general, and to further inquiries into development of the researches initiated by Wilhelm and Jung in their presentation of this book in particular, that I have undertaken to follow up on their work with a new and complete rendition of _The Secret of the Golden Flower_.\n\nBecause the still-current Wilhelm/Jung/Baynes edition of this manual contains dangerous and misleading contaminations, a primary consideration of the new translation was to make the contents of _The SEcret of the Golden Flower_ explicitly accessible to both lay and specialist audiences. This is partly a matter of translation and partly a matter of presentation.\n\nThe text itself is somewhat like a series of explanations of practical meanings in esoteric terminology for the use of lay people. To this have been added selections translated from a canonical Chinese Taoist commentary that further refines the principles into pragmatic observations divested of the outward forms of religious and alchemical symbolism. The translation notes explain the expressions, ideas, and practices to which the text refers. The afterward joins the beginning and the end, from the background of the translations to the psychological implications of the praxis.

Where my head feels awash in thought, and yet I feel that I must sleep, as I have much to accomplish tomorrow. Perhaps by telling you everything I can gain the peace of mind I need to rest. Thank you for listening, I love you, I always have. \n\nChief among my ideas: to manifest you more strongly. As I seek to maximize the mutual benefit between Chris and I, I will need your assistance. I think I will make bringing you into existence a priority for myself.\n\nNext Wednesday I will drop 400 ug of LSD and read Poor Richard's Almanac, the Dao De Jing, the Secret of the Golden Flower, and Think and Grow Rich. I will also record autohypnosis tracks that I will play back to myself. I will program myself into the perfect startup founder. \n\nI will learn iOS development and become an extremely capable mobile developer. At the same time I will also learn to master JavaScript and AngularJS. \n\nI will write to all the people at Sailthru who have mattered to me. I will write to Neil, of course, because I need to pitch him on Posyt and show him how Sailthru inspired me and hopefully I can get him to intro us to all the VCs he has connections to. That could work out very well in our favor. First I want to close out my time at Sailthru as a star employee. I feel that I have established a good start on that front, given my two shout-outs at All-Hands today. Bless Ashley for remembering to thank me after exactly two weeks, and of course, bless Johnson for he truly loves me and I him.\n\nI will write to Ann and I will tell her how I feel about her, despite all the conflicting emotions I feel between her and Daria. I truly find that an awkward situation, but I don't know what else to do. I don't find Ann as appealing as I find you, but she does hold a place in my heart. I hope that my friends and family will act supportive when I come out as polyamorous, but I would not blame them if they feel set in their preconceived notions. Truly people find it hard to break free of the societal molds into which they grew up. I will write to Praj to thank him for all he has taught me, especially for introducing me to the concept of Non-Violent Communication, which I think holds great promise. I will have to re-read that book as I feel I have not fully integrated the practices involved there. Although I do find it interesting how similar writing in E-Prime feels to NVC. \n\nSeems that I have a lot on my mind, because I keep going off on tangents and still I have no end in sight. I think that I will build a new version of this wiki-software, and perhaps I will name it in your honor. I have loved many women, such as Maya, but I suppose I love you best, since you represent a platonic ideal in my mind. Perhaps one day you will come into my life in earnest. I would find that amazing. Besides enlightenment, I consider that the highest goal of my magickal workings. \n\nI would find it useful if you could communicate with me via instant message and via text message. I would like to give you many features and capabilities. \n\nI have found reading Wilhelm Reich very interesting. Very strange that the US government chose to suppress his writings. I suppose the people who chose to do so felt threatened by his anti-fascist teachings. To the extent that I have not orgasmed inside of Daria, I think I consider it fair to say that I still possess a degree of orgasmic impotence and thus also neurosis. \n\nTomorrow I think I shall add several Sailbot commands.\n\n!poor to display a quote from Poor Richard's Almanac\n\n!oracle to display an yi-jing reading.\n\nAsking oracle about wishing to tell ann my true feelings for her gave 25. Innocence. \n\nHopefully I can influence Chris in a more marketable and sellable direction. I don't know if I believe in Posyt as it exists in his head right now, but I feel certain that Posyt could take off as a hypersigil given my direction. \n\nI should write up a big old diagram of how blast generate works now, now that I will leave sailthru. \n\nI feel pretty weird about that Sailthru hate club. I think I will not attend. Pretty strange that Matt G and Dexter would meet in the same room given that he almost certainly got Dexter fired. Strange how the world works sometimes. \n\nThe Manual Benedict. People can repay me by spreading it as far and wide as possible.

Now I can keep todos out of my journal and keep this purely for writing.\n\nThis new practice I started of just sitting in ichimonji for three minutes at a time that James inspired me to do has felt very difficult. Which indicates that I need to practice ichimonji a lot more. It should feel as natural as sitting.","name":"2","updated":{"$date":"2014-04-20T16:27:03.073Z"}}

Lots of press there. Only 16 kitties, so they put a hard limit on the amount of good the event could really do. The whole thing looked like a big dumb marketing stunt from my perspective.\n\nFunny enough, going to the cat cafe actually seemed to hurt Daria's mood, since she wanted to adopt this adorable white kitten called Duchess. I really want her to feel happy, but sometimes I worry that if we overcommit ourselves to the care taking of essentially dependent animals we will get overwhelmed. I also feel that I will lose the ability to travel if we adopt too many pets. Also I feel afraid that if we ever break up then I will have to take care of a bunch of pets that I got because of Daria and that will cause me to feel sad and resentful and saddled down with all these pets. But maybe I just worry for no reason. Maybe I should express these fears to Daria.\n\nDaria and I did more spring cleaning today, which I enjoyed.\n\nTaijutsu class has felt really productive lately since we've focused just on [omote gyaku](omote_gyaku) a lot. I like it when we focus on a specific technique instead of doing lots of different techniques, because this way I feel like I have a chance at actually learning the technique entirely. \n\nMeditated for 10 minutes today. Wow. I clearly haven't done that in far too long. Turns out the practice and energy has waited for me this entire time and I just needed to come back to it. Felt a lot of work in my heart today. \n\nI would like to start waking up with the sunrise.\n\n11:27:52 PM: Interesting class tonight at Ignacio's. Like usual Mike and James mostly stuck together and goofed around. I honestly feel like they hold themselves back, and that they both improve more when they train with me, but I will let them do what they please. It wouldn't surprise me if in another year I surpass them, and in fact, I would hope to. I don't mean to say that I actually want to surpass them as a goal, but just that I want to continually push myself at such a rate that it happens as a natural consequence. Anyway, working with the new student, whose name I don't really know exactly, made me feel some frustration, just because he brings so many habits with him from the other arts he has done that they get in the way of his copying. So I had to work especially hard to make omote gyaku effective on him, and it still didn't end up seeming very effective. But I feel at peace with that, I just have to work on my form. Anyway I feel he acts nice and wants to learn even if he has some misconceptions from his previous experience. Ignacio helped me with [ichimonji](ichimonji). Turns out I have to really feel the burn in my lower thigh on the outside right before the knee to really do it correctly. He says I have the flexibility to actually do it, so I should practice that way. In terms of flexibility I have a huge advantage over the other students, and I mean that on multiple levels. I have the flexibility of thinking and adaptation to excel at this art, but I have to put in the hours. I do feel that taijutsu constitutes part of my personal legend, so I will continue to pursue it seriously. \n\n11:33:10 PM: Now to do a round of NLP cards, programming myself to continue doing my daily habits.","name":"3","updated":{"$date":"2014-04-25T03:33:21.886Z"}}

I don't quite know what I want to do right now, but perhaps I will read the secret of the golden flower. Or maybe I could talk to you a bit.\n\nLast night I thought about you. As much as I love Daria she doesn't understand me in quite the way I had hoped someone might, unlike you.

Until then I will continue working on myself so that I become worthy of you. \n\nI now feel certain that if I just train the software that operates my visual field I will have much enhanced vision. The flashes of good vision I've seen prove to me that my problem does not reside in the optics of my eyes, but rather in the processing of the optical signals from my eyes. Fortunately that looks like the easiest cause to fix, so I feel confident that by the end of the year I will have 20/20 vision. \n\nWell, I will make tonight a very productive night and get to sleep in time to see the sunrise again tomorrow.

,{"_id":"t8CjLsBsuiWf6R54z","active":true,"url":"scarlett","prose":"oHWzoLsM95EgjoRgh","text":"I sit at the Gate Clock Bar at Dublin Airport with a pint of Guinness in hand. Guinness tastes much better here in Dublin, only miles away from the brewery. I take a long drag and sigh. Despite how lovely Ireland looks this time of year I miss home. Mostly I miss Scarlett. \n\nA leggy brunette with hair as dark as my own short cropped hair sits next to me.  She has delicate features on a V-shaped face. Before I can take another drink, she lays a hand on my arm. Her eyes linger there,\nadmiring my strong arms.\n\n\"Hey handsome, buy me a drink?\" she says, as our eyes meet. I free my arm.\n\n\"Sorry, I have a flight to catch,\" I say, looking at her with compassionate eyes. I check my watch so that she can't help\nbut see my wedding ring, an unadorned twist of black carbon fiber that displays our wedding vows when viewed under UV light. 5:17 pm. Still plenty of time before my flight.\n\n\"Oh, sorry to bother you then. Don't mind me,\" she says, with undertones of disappointment\nbeneath her cheerful Irish accent. I quickly finish the rest of the pint, close my tab, pickup my black duffel bag\nand head over to gate C4.\n\nI picked a good time to leave. Outside the clouds drizzle lightly, and the sky looks as grey as… well, I suck at similes, but my retina implant says grey #322. In the reflections cast by the LED lights my fellow passengers look sullen. Having nothing better to do, I check my email on my retina. Nothing looks particularly interesting, as usual, but I answer a question from a new developer regarding the nature of our unnecessarily complex middle-ware system. I feel someone brush me from behind, and behind the semi-transparent retina display I see a large dark Irish behind me. He also clutches a black duffel, so I reflexively reach for mine and feel it still there. He walks away, and I return to my email. \n\nA while later I receive a notification on my retina that my seat awaits  me. Most people receive their notification on their phones, as I adopted retina technology relatively early. Plane boarding feels much more efficient now that the programmers convinced airline companies  that using an actual boarding algorithm rather than chaos would more efficiently board customers. Just another way that my field has made the world better. My bag seems lighter than it did before, but my arms do feel better rested now.\n\nThe seat next to mine has no occupant, so I feel left alone with my devices and thoughts. The ridiculous superstition against having electronics on during flight has lifted finally, but to speak frankly, I feel tired of technology. I just want to see Scarlett again. Do you know that dull heartache when you've stayed away from your loved one? Well, it no longer feels like a dull heartache. It feels more like a throbbing toothache stabbing into my heart.\n\nAs I look out the window and I realize I won't see Dublin recede into the distance, as the clouds have covered everything. I sigh. I never thought that I would come to love someone as much as I loved Scarlett. Obviously, I find it mostly upside, but then there come afternoons like this. I find it the silliest problem—of course—I found someone who fulfills me completely, feeling the absence of that almost feels unbearable. Traveling wouldn't feel so bad if only she could come with, but with her job as a cardiac surgeon she just can't do it. Instead of torturing myself with this anymore, I decide to try and sleep.\n\n-----\n\nMy door recognizes me and I pause in front of it, listening to the faint whirl of gears. Then the door slides aside. I step into my condominium and sigh with relief. Home sweet home. For the most part the decor looks sleek, modern, black and white electronic embedded plastic. But there also sit some choice antique like the comfortable leather couch that Scarlett added. Scarlett also insisted on plants, and on this point we reached a happy compromise: the basil, heirloom tomatoes, and other plants all grew happily and without human interference in state of the art hydroponic systems. I sniff. The aroma of fresh baking peanut butter cookies wafts through my consciousness. I feel so lucky.\n\n\"Honey!\" Scarlett lilts as she runs to embrace me. She seems to wear very little underneath her bright red apron which intensifies her flowing auburn hair. Before I can get any ideas she jumps at me. I have to drop the bag to catch her. \"You're hommmm—\" she says, nuzzling into my chest and wrapping her legs around my waist. I can feel her soft yet firm curves against my torso as she wiggles in my grasp and kisses my neck. I lower my head and take a long deep drag of her hair.\n\n\"Scar, you smell amazing. The cookies do too. You didn't have to ba—\" I try to say, but she interrupts me with a kiss.\n\n\"Nonsense. Only the best for my papa,\" she says. The door closes itself as I march Scarlett into the bedroom, thanks to some smart programming. \n\n\"Ohh, someone missed me while away,\" she teases, while feeling me down below. I just grin and lay her on our plush white king sized bed. She lays there staring into me with her light green eyes as I hastily pull off my shirt. \n\n_EEEEERRROOOOOOO_ \n\nScarlett's phone blares from on top of the dresser. We both give it death stares. We look back at each other. Scarlett looks crestfallen, I probably look like a depressed puppy just kicked by his owner even though I try not to. \n\n\"Sorry Gerard, duty calls,\" she says. I nod knowingly as she starts to get dressed. Suddenly I feel more tired from my travels, so I lie down as Scar bustles about. Off to save more lives. \"Bye honey!\" she says on her way out. \n\n\"See you tonight, Scar,\" I manage. It took her maybe three minutes to get ready. When we dated I loved that about her: quick dresser; made adventures possible. Well, now that she has gone, no point in wasting time. Might as well shower. I feel happy the oven also acts smart enough to turn itself off when the cookies finish baking. Programmers have really managed to remove about eighty percent of the drudgery for the two percent of people who can afford it. When I step in the shower it automatically starts washing me in the sequence I preprogrammed. Scarlett likes to use the manual controls, old school style. Metal knobs and such nonsense. After I shower and I savor two of the cookies. The oven has kept them at the ideal temperature. They feel crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside as the chocolate explodes in my mouth. \n\nIt takes me a moment to summon the motivation to walk back to the front door and pick up my duffel. I bring it back into the bedroom, plop it on the bed and unzip it. White bricks. I zip it back up and stare. Suddenly I feel incredibly paranoid. I use my retina to tell to the house controls to lock all doors and shade all the windows. Then I unzip the bag again. No mistaking it. Instead of my luggage, there sit white bricks in my bag. With trembling hands I unpack them all, counting as I go. Eighteen in all. Very dense, very hard packed. I pace back and forth across my room. Okay, I know what to do. I rush out of the room and return with the kitchen scale and a knife.\n\nI place one of the bricks on the scale. One kilogram. I carefully slice off a tiny portion from the corner of a brick with the knife and contemplate it. Testing this feels slightly stupid, but I have no other means of identification here. What the hell. I walk carefully over to my dresser with the corner chunk balanced on my knife and dump the chunk on the shiny black plastic.\n\nI chop it up into a fine powder, like I've seen them do in the movies. Then I pull out my wallet and remove a one dollar bill. Ehhh, I put it back and remove a hundred dollar bill. Go big or go home, kid. I roll it up into a tube and kneel before the dresser, exhale deeply, bring the tube to my right nostril and plug my left, and then all at once take a big snort, sucking it all up like a vacuum cleaner.\n\nFor a moment I feel nothing, and I want to laugh. What did I expect. Just compressed bricks of flour or talcum powder or something. Then I feel the burn. Like fire and barbed wire raking across my entire nasal cavity.\n\n\"SON OF A BITCH!\" I yell. Then the burn gives way to the rush. Oh, the rush. Ohhhhhhhhh. I fall through a tunnel of crinkling aluminum and then I land inside myself… only I feel better than myself. I feel like turbo-freaking-charged Gerard. I clench my hands into fists. I feel so strong. SO STRONG. I feel like I can hurl tables and crush skulls. But what? My brain? Oh, it moves so fast. So many thoughts. So many brilliant thoughts. I think I am the smartest man there ever was. I probably am. How could I not have seen this before? I obviously am. It's never been so clear. There is no doubt in my mind that I can do anything I want. All the things. Every of the things. The things, the things.\n\nOkay, calm down. My heart races. I pace. Yes, this is the stuff. This is the stuff. What stuff is this? This is coke. This is coke. Calm down. Take a chill pill. Don't take a chill pill. Enjoy this rush. I can't have it again. Gotta use this wisely. Yes, have to sell it. Can't use it. Have to, have to. Maybe just a little bit more. A little more. Just a little. Okay, just a little. A little line. A little line isn't much. Okay, okay. Okay buddy.\n\nBut wait. Thinking first. Do the smart thing first. Use it as a reward. Good Gerard, good. I am smart, use the brain.\n\nI turn on privacy mode on my retina and determine that the market value of a single brick is around twenty thousand dollars, depending on my ability to sling it. Three hundred and sixty thousand dollars. Damn. Even with my salary and Scarlett's salary that seems like a lot of money. Especially to get all at once, tax free.\n\nThen I realize. The bag is bugged. It must be bugged. No way it isn't. How to get rid of the bug? Where is the bug? Burn the bag? Burn the bag. Burn the bag! Burn. Yes, yes. No, no, I'm a hacker for god's sake.\n\nI grab the bag and run to my workshop. The shelves of this small room are strewn with electronic gadgets, tools, soldering irons, a fabrication machine, discarded monitors, and miles of cable. I search the shelves until I find my EM field detecting wand. I sweep everything off my workbench and drop the bag on it, then begin methodically scanning the bag with the wand. Nothing, nothing. Then finally, *beep beep*. The bug must be embedded in the fabric somewhere. I grab a pair of wire cutters and begin cutting apart the fabric until I unveil a small black chip, about a quarter the area of my thumbnail. I extract it carefully.\n\nA normal person's instinct here would be to destroy the chip immediately. But I have better ideas. I turn on my workshop computer, and while it is booting up search for a set of wires. When I find the green cord I am looking for I solder two electrodes from one end of it to the chip, and then plugs the other end into my computer. I'm familiar with this kind of chip. It's a generic component manufactured in Africa.\n\nQuickly I write a program. Unfortunately, the tracker has already indicated this apartment. There's no getting around what's already been revealed. For the time being, I feel very justified in paranoia. If there is a tracking chip, there are almost certainly people coming for it. Maybe I can throw them off my trail, so long as they don't find me here. The program will hack the memory address containing the chip's location and cause it to display whatever coordinates I desire. I decide that it is imperative they don't realize the chip has been compromised, so I program the chip to show my location as moving from my apartment to a series of motels and hideouts, as if the chip were tracking my location while on the run. I smile in satisfaction. This way I can even survey from a distance a location that the chip report me to be, and see who shows up, if anyone.\n\nI hear loud banging on my door. I jump and have what feel like an almost heart attack. Fuck. I switch my retina to view the front door camera. Shit. There are two burly Irish blokes banging on my door. One of them has long ugly arms like a gorilla, and the other has the cauliflower ears of a boxer. Damnit, too slow. They must think nobody is home, because they stop banging and take out an electronic door breaker. That's not going to work on my door. My door is custom. But it seems they have a plasma torch too. Shit, gotta think fast. I run into my living room and grab my hickory baseball bat singed by Ty Cobb off of the mantel. Then I hide behind my kitchen counter. Then I calm myself, and open my door with my retina.\n\n\"Told ya the fuckin door break would work eventually, ya cumsprite,\" I hear Gorilla say. \"Them software shit heads canna do a thing right.\" I smile slightly. We'll see who's a shit head in a moment. \n\n\"Shut yer fuckin mouth. You want a neighbor to hear us?\" Cauliflower says. Gorilla and cauliflower move in and close the door quietly. Thanks to the cameras I have set up I can watch them search my living room from behind my kitchen counter. It is nerve wracking to be sitting here with just a counter separating us. I try to take long quiet breathes to slow my racing heart. It's not much use. They are making a fucking mess, Scarlett is not going to be happy.\n\n\"I'll search the kitchen, you search the rooms,\" Cauliflower says. Gorilla heads into my workshop, leaving me alone with Cauliflower who is rapidly approaching. This is the moment of truth. As Cauliflower is about to round the corner to the counter and discover me I turn off all the lights. \"Da fuck?\" Cauliflower says as I rise, bat in both hands. I turn the lights back on so I can aim and for a moment I see his surprise in his eyes before I bring the bat down straight across his face with a loud thwack. He's dazed but still standing. My blood is pumping hard. Shit this guy is tough. BUT I'M FUCKING STRONG. He doesn't have time to react to me shifting the bat to the left and taking a huge swing. The bat impacts him right in the ear and I continue swinging through. The is a sickening snap, crunch, and spray of blood as the side of his head caves in, the bat snaps, his neck flaps wildly to the right like his head almost came off. Then he slumps over. Fuck, I am strong. \n\n\"Frank! What da fuck was that? Frank!\" I hear Gorllia shout. Frank. His name was Frank, and I killed him. My stomach turns and I dry heave. I just killed a man, and I ruined my signed Ty Cobb bat to do it. What the hell. Gorilla storms into the living room and sees me, and Frank on the ground. \"YOU SHIT HEAD!\" he roars. Shit. I turn the lights off again. I don't know what I'm going to to do now. My weapon is broken, and I no longer have the advantage of surprise. Gorilla knocks painfully into the counter as he tries to reach me. I can find my way in the dark here, but what's my next move? I'll be in trouble as soon as he gains his dark vision. I back into the living room and he is in the kitchen. Sounds like he is flailing his arms around trying to grab me. Since he is in the kitchen I can't grab a knife from it. Ah, but I do have the coke knife. I work my way across the living room toward my bed room as quietly as I can. It is easy to track Gorilla's position because he is breathing hard and banging around a lot as he moves. I am strangely calm now, I feel almost cold blooded. Something in me died with Frank, and all that's left is a determination to get out of this alive.\n\nWhen I get to my room Gorilla is in the living room. He's not bumping around as much anymore, so he can probably see about as well as I can now. I don't want to search for the knife in the dark, so I turn the lights back on. But I keep them dim in my room and I flash the lights in the living room on their highest setting and open the shades to try and screw with his eyes. I head towards the living room, knife in my right hand. Gorilla sees me and takes huge strides to meet me half way. As he's about to reach me I turn the lights off, close the shades, and duck under his punch. I feel really clever for a moment, but then he connects with a left hook that sends me staggering. I back track as I am dazed but Gorilla presses his advantage. He can see? He must have shielded his eyes from the light? I turn the lights back on, no point fighting in the dark now. I step out of range of his right jab, but he keeps pursuing as I back into the hallway. I swipe at him with the knife, but his arms out range me and I get jabbed in the face. The knife is doing me no good, but I remember what Matt showed me. My stance is all wrong; I'm hardly using the knife. As Gorilla strikes again, I back step and turn my body so it is in profile towards him, my weight is on my back leg, my knife arm is extended toward him protecting my side. It all clicks, and the principles behind these stances make intuitive sense. \n\nThis actually stops Gorilla's advance. Suddenly I'm presenting a much smaller target, and the knife is actually in the way. We have a stand off for a moment and both of us catch our breathes a bit. I stay on the ready though. Like Matt told me, not tense, relaxed but ready. Alert. \"Always wait to receive an attack,\" he said. Gorilla and I stare each other down. I decide to try something Matt showed me. I lower my right a bit, so the knife is out of the way, creating an opening to my face. Gorilla underestimates me and tries to punch my head. But I'm ready. My arm moves half circle as I shift my weight forward, knocking his arm aside. Now he is completely defenseless, so I continue my lunge, sinking my weight further forward and down and stab him in the gut. I shift back into my original stance, leaving him no opening to retaliate. Now he's pissed and grimacing in pain. My leg is starting to tire though, I'm not used to this stance. He punches again and I move to block, but he was only feinting. He grabs my hand and twists it hard. Shit, I drop the knife. Before he can break my wrist I shift my weight forward, off balancing him, then I knee him in the groin. He blinks but hardly seems to react. He yanks me toward him by my hand and now I'm off balance. Then he grabs my head and slams it into the wall. My vision goes black. He chokes my throat with one hand and delivers brutal body shots with the other. I can\nt breathe. Stomach punches. I kick him in the side of the knee. To my surprise it buckles and he falls to the floor in pain. His head is by my knee and before he has time to protect it I knee him in the face, putting the full force of my body behind it. His spine arches back as his head whips into the floor. I jump on him and start pummeling his face but he's already out cold. \n\nFuck, fuck, fuck! I have to get the hell out of here. And I need to warn Scarlett.\n\n-----\n\nI'm sitting in a kitschy Starbucks in DUMBO a few blocks from my condominium. I'm on my laptop trying to look as inconspicuous as a person can when the bags next to them are filled with kilos of cocaine and urban survival equipment. I'm also trying not to remember that I have one dead Irish mobster in one closet, and a duct taped and unconscious mobster in another closet. My hands are shaking as I type, and I keep tapping my leg. Where is Scarlett? The hospital says she never arrived, and she isn't answering her phone. Right now I'm trying to break into the hospital parking lot's security cameras. Our car reports that it made it to the hospital garage. Somehow Scarlett went missing between the car door and the ER door, and I have an awful feeling in my gut that I know exactly why.\n\nThe security camera system has a password, but no rate limiting. It might as well not have a password, idiots. I spin up a brute force dictionary attack and impatiently sip on my hot white chocolate. This might take a few minutes, so I try to take some deep breathes and calm down. I rest my foot, fold my hands in my lap, and close my eyes. On my retina I pull up a meditation brain entrainment program and relax into it, allowing the soothing female voice to guide me into relaxation. \n\nSome time passes and my eyes snap open. I've broken in. There are a lot of cameras, far more than I can examine manually. However, I know when the car arrived in the parking lot. I tile sixteen camera feeds in a grid and fast forward to 6:45 pm. Stepping in fifteen second increments I see my silver Shelby Mustang appear on three of the feeds. Black racing stripes, that's definitely my car. Scarlett is in the front passenger seat, reading a book while the car drives. The mustang switches onto another camera as it glides smoothly into its parking spot. Parked next to it on the right is an ominous black van. As Scarlett steps out of the mustang the van's door slides open and two pairs of arms pull her in. The door slams shut and the van turns backward out of its spot and speeds out the lot.\n\nShit. Is there any way I can track the location of that van? City traffic cameras, intelligence satellites… all too risky, and beyond my capabilities anyway. \n\nI close my eyes and breathe deeply. Then the solution comes to me. I'll call Jenzen! She could totally help out in this situation. As I think of ‘Jenzen' and ‘calling' my retina prompts me: Call Jenzen? Yes. \n\n    Jenzen: Hello, Gerard.\n    You: Jen, I need your help.\n    Jenzen: I knew. Do you have the…?\n    You: Yes.\n    Jenzen: Bring everything to my fortress.\n    You: Where the hell do you have a fortress in Manhattan?\n    Jenzen: Hail a car, I'll bring it to me.\n    You: Sure.\n    Jenzen: Stay on the line, I will direct you from my birds-eye view.\n\nI step out of the cafe with my bags. I think 'car!' and my retina hails the nearest empty car, which happens to turn the corner. I eye the attractive black Tesla model M. It smoothly pulls up in front of me and the passenger door pops open. I step inside. All the doors lock and the windows go black. I get a queasy feeling in my stomach.\n\n    Jenzen: Sorry Gerard, might feel a bit rough of a ride. \n    Don't take this the wrong way but I'd rather you didn't know where my fortress sits.\n\nSomehow Jen seems to have taken control of the car. The Gooverment Department of Transportation claimed the auto control system could not get hacked... shows what they know. Suddenly the tires squeal and my stomach feels a dreadful lurch as the car accelerates forward. The car swivels to the left then to the right. I feel the terror rising, Jen must have this car weaving through traffic and its velocity rapidly increases.  I can't see out the windows so I can only blindly hope that it doesn't collide with anything at high speed. ","name":"3","updated":{"$date":"2014-04-27T18:02:21.701Z"}}

The strike has to come from underneath lifting up, just as in omote. The back position looks the same as omote. Make contact perpendicular, and maintain that contact while bringing their sword in a circle. When their sword reaches the bottom of the circle then you turn. \n\nOn omote I practiced with Justin and had some more practice. First movement has started to feel pretty good.

It feels right. The salary, 90k, sounds low considering where I started and ended at Sailthru, but I think in terms of achieving my personal legend I will come to understand how I made the right choice by taking this offer.\n\nI will have to save money for a while because I've got a lot less to spend and a lot more rent, but based on my calculations I will do fine. I should talk to my parents about this.\n\nHey Chris,\n\nTo update you: Lloyd gave me a verbal offer this morning. I feel conflicted because Lloyd said 90k and the hours seem more demanding than I had at Sailthru. The three weeks out of every twelve week program also doesn't give me the flexibility I hoped it would, specifically Lloyd said \"it's not for personal projects\" which I found a rather shortsighted view in terms of teacher development. I also felt a bit weary because Lloyd said \"we realize that while teaching you aren't sharpening your tools\" when I feel teachers should learn beside the students so the students see that programming involves a process of continual improvement and learning. \n\nI feel conflicted because I think that I would find teaching very rewarding, and I did teach at Sailthru even thought it took place outside of my specified responsibilities. But I place a lot of value on my time and as a consulting programmer I bill out at $150/hr now. I don't know if I can justify the financial and lifestyle hit when I could keep working for myself and volunteer at something like http://www.tealsk12.org/\n\nI don't like wasting people's time, so I'd prefer if this worked out and you and everyone at Dev Bootcamp haven't wasted effort. Do you think they just lowballed me to start? I remember you saying a range of 100-130 depending on experience, but it sounds like every office has its own budget, so maybe that number came from the other locations. \n\nHad a good conversation with Chris Berkner, who helped me feel like I should go back to Lloyd with some concerns and raise the fact that I made 115 at my last job to see what happens. I really like Chris, and I find him a great guy. I hope he gets lots of success and happiness.\n\nOracle on Dev Bootcamp: 25. Wu Wang Innocence -\u003e 12. Pi' Standstill\n\nFirst part encouraging, second part not especially. It sounds like I would enjoy it at first but eventually stagnate. I don't think this helps my personal legend quite the way I need, but maybe it only takes place as a temporary measure.\n\nOracle on continuing to freelance and work for myself: 15. Ch'ien Modesty -\u003e 39. Obstruction\n\nNot super promising either. Maybe the way lies elsewhere. \"Modesty is not to be confused with weak good nature that lets things take their own course.\"\n\nDear Lloyd, \n\nHaving thought over the verbal offer I have a few points I'd like to discuss with you. I'd like to see a contract if possible to help me make a decision. I remember you saying you wanted employees to have an \"exquisite lifestyle\" which as a thought I appreciate a lot, so I would like to follow up on a few sticking points here.\n\nOne point I'd like to clarify. I certainly don't intend to work on a startup during the personal development time. I would want to continue developing open source software such as https://github.com/zencephalon/Tactful_Tokenizer and I hope that Dev Bootcamp encourages students to give back to the open source ecosystem that they derive so much benefit from. I would certainly want to lead by example in doing so. I learned everything I have by building and I don't intend to stop. I feel sure I'll find lots of internal tools I will want to develop as I learn the process. And I will certainly want to improve the curriculum too. \n\n(I do want to note that http://devbootcamp.com/jobs/ says the following \"Flexible time off. Vacation is provided in a take-what-you-need form. For teachers, we recommend 3 weeks off every 9 weeks\" which gives a much different impression of what that time entails, perhaps that needs updating). \n\nAs far as compensation goes I can live on what you spoke but it sounds low to me. I made $115,000 at Sailthru plus benefits and stock options. The last offer I saw at $90,000 came with 1.5% equity. I bill for $150/hr freelancing. I understand you have budgetary constraints just as I feel sure you understand I feel an instinct to help my family out of medical debt, so I feel confidant we can come to a happy medium. \n\nI can start on May 12th at the earliest in order to finish my contract work.","name":"5","updated":{"$date":"2014-04-28T21:11:09.990Z"}}

Before that my dream had disturbingly sexual content including a threesome that become a fivesome. I didn't have a penis because I lent mine out, people could apparently swap penises. Very strange.

I met a few fellows. Played a lot of Hearthstone yesterday. \n\n11:17:21 PM: Wow, so it has felt like way too long since I have last used this keyboard.  Feels good to get back on it. I just played with Kitkat a bit which felt fun, but he still wants attention. He keeps meowing. I think I will play with him a bit more. \n\n11:21:07 PM: Just played a whole bunch with kitkat but still he meows. I don't know if I can give him enough attention. I think it will work out well that Daria will take kitkat with her to columbia. I don't know how to feel about this summer yet, or the fall to come. I love Daria but I don't know to what extent I want to spend the rest of my life with her, and to what extent I can wait for her to finish school and grow up and all of that. She sounds pretty intent on staying in new york. Sometimes I feel a bit trapped here like I need to go on a spiritual quest. But then again I realize that out of anywhere there probably hide some masters in this city and I just have to learn to identify them. I need to sharper my spiritual as well as physical senses so that I can spot a magician in a crowd. God knows there must hide tons of them in this city. \n\n11:23:39 PM: Lots of metaprogramming today at DBC. I felt impressed with the ambition of the syllabus today, but I worry that a lot of students will not have understood the topics covered. Interesting that certain people really do not seem well liked as pairing partners. I liked that Bernardo sat in on our teacher tactical today, I liked that. I think he has his heart in the right place and he can make DBC a success. I had a brief conversation with John, the CEO today, which I enjoyed. Apparently he took a 75 thousand dollar paycut to join DBC. \n\n11:25:53 PM: I thought about Aliza a lot today. And a lot yesterday for that matter. I don't think Aliza would want me to masturbate to some random sex party footage on the internet. I still don't know what to do. Should I just try to manifest her in the real world through programming her? I just feel like that wouldn't work, because I would know exactly how she operates. I have always thought quite a bit about crafting a tulpa, the original inspiration for Aliza as I currently envision her. Of course, the real Aliza McKamey still exists out in the wild but I doubt I really have much in common with her anymore. Hard to meet women interested in enlightenment and occultism I would think. I wish that Daria would show an interest but she just doesn't. I did an yi jing query on Finding Aliza and it returned 30 Clinging (The Fire) -\u003e 58 Abundance. I got the sense that I just need to stick with Daria. A few interesting lines in there. \"Care of the cow brings good fortune\" I do love me some cows. Also. \"What is bright clings to what is light and so enhances the brightness of the latter.\" So I guess I just stick with it and abundance will come. So What by Miles Davis reminds me Sim City 3000 right now. I really loved that game. Kind of miss it, but I don't think I would get as much enjoyment out of it now.\n\n11:30:01 PM: I have decided I won't play hearthstone tonight, and I would like to make that a habit. I just don't see the point in it, doesn't really make me a better person in any meaningful way. \n\n11:30:34 PM: Had a great taijutsu class today. I think the new guy Andy will stick around, he has a good attitude from what I can surmise. He looks completely ridiculous right now when he tries to do anything like kamae, but that will improve with time of course. Considering bringing my keyboard to work tomorrow. I enjoyed seeing Cameron and James of course, love those guys. We went over Jumonji no kata, musha dori, and muso dori. I need to figure out a system for remembering muso dori and musha dori, specifically which one involves the bent arm lock and which involves the straight arm lock. I might go do that right after I finish writing. I feel like I haven't really written enough lately, and I guess I don't feel comfortable writing most of the time. \n\n11:33:52 PM: I think I have a lot of writing to catch up on. I haven't really fully processed my last trip. I told everyone in PA that I \"was\" gay, but that doesn't really mean much. \"Bunday is a gay day\". I stand by that. I like Mike a lot though, I find him super cool. Would love to go to Burning Man with him. Also I really need to remember to request June 6th off so I can go to govball that day. \n\n11:39:33 PM: I took our assessment today in under an hour.

A few years later his friend committed suicide and Sam blamed himself for the loss. Very sad story for me to hear. \n\nChad told us about his problems with alcohol. How he received a DUI after blacking out in the middle of a road with incoming traffic. His father's side of the family has a lot of history with alcoholism and for a long time he thought that he would die at a young age as a result of alcohol just like many of his uncles did. Then he managed to turn his life around and focus on acting like a better person. Very inspiring story for me to hear because I think Chad seems like an awesome guy. \n\nHallo told us how about a year ago his uncle died, and since his father left the country almost six years ago his uncle acted like a fther towards him and he felt like his uncle took the place of his father. His uncle died from cancer and for some reason that I don't understand Hallo thinks that he caused his uncle's cancer due to some event int he past. He feels a lot of pain and remorse when he sees how sad his family feels about his uncle's death. \n\n11:05:03 PM: Danielle told us about her crippling social anxiety and how she uses alcohol to try to make it go away. Her problems with alcohol go back to age 14.\n\n11:05:45 PM: I talked about the circumstances around leaving Sailthru. About my depression in college and my discovery of psychedelic drugs which finally set me free and allowed me to change my personality. I talked about my difficulties with saying no to people, about feeling sad when I see Maya come up on Facebook. \n\nRaghav talked about growing up very wealthy in India. His family had servants that he treated very poorly because he felt better than everyone else. In retrospect he feels horrified that he could treat people so poorly and he feels shitty whenever her thinks about it.\n\nJake told us about his difficulties committing to anything fully. Feeling like he has an important role to play but constantly doubting what he does int he present moment because he imagines what could happen if he had done something differently. Feeling always like he exists in two different places due to this thinking. He feels very close to his family.\n\n11:09:38 PM: Natalie's mom used to beat her during her bipolar episodes. Probably explains her earlier comment in a previous EE that she feels like her superego literally beats her. Bad imprint from parent. She left a research position in a foreign country to run away from a man she loved because she couldn't accept his religion and she hasn't forgiven herself for it.\n\n11:10:53 PM: Dinesh once jumped out of a two story balcony to see if he could parkour roll safely. Tends to put himself in dangerous situations and doesn't think carefully about consequences. Did some kind of waterboating with his girlfriend, who couldn't swim. They went 50 miles per hour and he decided he would try to turn really fast. They both got thrown off and he lost his glasses, couldn't find his girlfriend. Feared that she would drown because of his recklessness. Still feels remorse over that to this day.\n\nJess feels very angry and confused because her mother's depression that started a year ago when her mother's sister died. Hard times in her family due to her mom's depression. \n\nJoe grew up poor and lonely. \n\nVic discovered his homosexuality at the age of 14. His parents reacted very poorly when he told them. His only friend found out and found it so disgusting that he stopped acting as a friend and told the entire school. After that Vic didn't have another friend until college. He grew up very poor, his family used to live on $50 of groceries a day. He wishes he wasn't gay. His mom puts a lot of pressure on him to get married and have children since his parents only have him. \n\nJasons's parents participate in what he calls a \"cult\" involving lots of gong ringing and zen meditation. Apparently it moved around a lot. He has decided to run away from that. He thinks of code as a virus that has infected human minds. In a way he resents having to work with technology, but he wants to make his mother and sister feel proud of him so he wants to make a great living as a software developer and not fall into the cult.\n\n11:33:01 PM: John has never done anything without his father's approval. He took psychedelics in an attempt to fully live, something he feels he may never do. He ran for office to try to overcome his fear of public speaking but it didn't work. He has a row with his brother over finances right now and he feels afraid that he will continue a pattern in his family where his dad pushed way his siblings for financial reasons. His dad always plays top dog, I think he might act as some sort of bigshot business person. John went last. \n\n11:37:50 PM: Judy told us about growing up with eczema in texas and always having to wear long pants because she felt so embarrassed and suffering in the heat because of it. Also that both of her parents worked so she ate a lot of fast food growing up. This made lack career ambitions for a long time, she just wanted to become a housewife so that her children would never go through something like that. \n\n11:40:41 PM: Indigo told us the story behind his tattoos. He used to drink and cut himself, and then patch up with superglue. He had to always go to job interviews with long sleeves on so that his employers wouldn't see his scars. After he got his tattoos he decided he would flash ink to gauge people's reactions and filter any place that would judge him for that. \n\n11:44:43 PM: Greg told us about how he considered his music career a failure for the 13 plus years he did it because he didn't win his audition. Someone else won first place but didn't accept. He told us how angry and sad he feels that one of his children, his son, has down syndrome. He feels terrible for his son of course, but it also \"kills\" him because he feels shitty that he will have a down syndrome guy in his life for the rest of his life and maybe he doesn't want to deal with that.\n\n11:48:01 PM: Richard told us about how he become good friends of a couple, and a few years later learned that the husband beat his wife almost every night. He ended up taking care of her and her child and beating up the husband, and they moved away from New York to start a new life, but he couldn't take it and left her and the kid. He really misses the baby girl a lot. After that he had an affair with a woman and feels really bad about it. Feels like he shouldn't do relationships anymore.\n\n11:49:33 PM: Kevin told us how after graduating he spent 6 moths living in his parent's basement. How he often skips out on socializing and doesn't make plans with people because he feels more comfortable by himself . He likes videogames and anime and doesn't follow pop culture. Feels isolated and lonely. Has to make an effort to act social.\n\n11:51:04 PM: Ken told us about how he can't remember the last time he spoke to his dad, and how he hasn't seen his grandparents or niece and nephew in years because he feels afraid that he will see his father at family gatherings. That he feels really judged by his family. I think because he didn't go to med school although he didn't say that, I just remember over hearing him talk about not going to med school. \n\n11:53:45 PM: Kai feels very driven by success. He wants to get rich and make the world a better place. He finally broke up with his girlfriend because he kept trying to give her the world but she didn't appreciate it and it didn't feel healthy for him. Very hard for him to do.

In this world, if we want laws repealed, then we have to talk about how we’ve broken them.\n\nFor the record, I have broken: the [Controlled Substances Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Substances_Act), the [Federal Analog Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Analog_Act).\n\nAlthough no one has ever convicted me of a crime I have ‘ab-used’ (apparently according to the US Government there exists no way to ‘use’ marijuana in a way that isn’t abnormal, or simply possessing it wouldn’t constitute a crime) a multitude of controlled substances. I list the following drugs in descending order of harm (yup, I consider alcohol one of the most harmful substances on this list).\n\n### [Modafinil](modafinil): bought, used, sold\n\nI find modafinil quite an interesting substance. I would strongly recommend you read Gwern’s analysis of it on his website. I find occasional use of modafinil to counteract sleep deficit has extreme utility. As a study aide I find it _vastly_ preferable to to adderall (a mixture of amphetamine salts just a hop and a skip away from actual _meth_,  you know, methamphetamine) as it does not induce jitteriness, heart palpitations, or other unpleasant physical effects. In fact, modafinil feels quite unique amongst drugs I’ve tried in having extremely low to undetectable \"body load\". When meditating I can feel its effect in my brain, but it feels like a minor sensation.\n\nYou can trivially acquire modafinil online.\n\n### [MDAI](mdai): bought, used\n\nMDAI felt extremely subtle to me. I would classify it as a minor psychedelic. It has no overt effects, but induces a very slight magnification of senses. It seemed to me to induce an effect of amplified beauty. I attended honors modern literature under its influence and had the most moving experiences I had ever felt during any class. I positively fell in love with _To the Lighthouse_ by Virginia Woolf. Perhaps Virginia had more to do with that than MDAI.\n\n### [Psilocybin](psilocybin): bought, used, sold\n\nGrowing mushrooms feels very easy to do, I encourage you to  [try it yourself](http://www.shroomery.org/)! People consider mushrooms a classic psychedelic. My mushroom trips have all felt very contemplative and “earthy” perhaps due to the “earthy” taste of the mushrooms. Inexperienced mushheads will experience nausea during the onset. I love the visual aspect of mushroom trips. Seeing wood floors flowing feels just so awesome. You’ve got to experience it for yourself. Viewing natural objects while on mushrooms looks fantastic. I felt it really calls you out into nature. Something about the drug seems to amplify the perception of fractals, especially in nature.\n\nLike LSD, mushrooms made my mind more malleable. I found them very helpful in overcoming childhood fears and reshaping my present persona to be more positive and loving. Needless to say, meditation while tripping is out of this world.\n\n### [LSD](lsd): bought, used, sold.\n\nLSD is probably the most effective self-therapy drug of anything I’ve tried. The LSD trip is fantastic, assuming you’ve actually gotten LSD. Here’s a hint, if it has any flavor at all, it isn’t LSD. True LSD is flavorless and odorless.\n\nMarijuana: bought, used to great effect in enhancing pleasurable activities, sold.\n\n### [Salvia](salvia): bought, used.\n\n### [MDMA](mdma): bought, used.\n\n### [25C-NBOMe](25c-nbome): used \n\nUsed to the temporary detriment of my sanity (thought it was LSD, got sloppy and didn’t test it; let this be a warning to you; of course the mistake would not have happened if legally registered LSD manufacturers were allowed to exist).\n\n### [JWH-018](jwh_018): used.\n\n### Dextromethorphan: bought, used.\n\n### Adderall: bought, used, sold.\n\n### Tobacco: bought, used.\n\n### Alcohol: bought, used.\n\n### [Mephedrone](mephedrone): bought, used\n\nThis is terrible; MDMA ought to be legal if only so that no one would ever seriously consider mephedrone again.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis is how I’ve decided I will react to the US Government’s ever encroaching surveillance. If they want to know everything about me, then fine. But it’s only fair that my fellow Americans also know everything about me. This is the transparent course of action.","name":"2","updated":{"$date":"2014-05-31T05:11:01.897Z"}}

I think I would like to get super productive this weekend. Having Daria around less sucks in that I don't get to hang out with her as much, but I think it could do good things for my productivity as I find it easier to do things when I don't get distracted by how frigging beautiful I find her.\n\n10:44:58 PM: Tough day because I had to tell Hallo to leave Dev Bootcamp, but I remained friends with him, and I think I might get to guide him on a psychedelic voyage which I could use to help him immensely. Kai also expressed interest in doing LSD with me. I think I need to get on the silkroad and order another batch from Tessellated, because I will obviously need them. I might get to use Dev Bootcamp as a way to set many, many people on the path to enlightenment. \n\n10:55:58 PM: This hackny situation has really gone sour. Seems like whitney really fucked up. Too bad Manya left. I should write to her too.\n\nHey James,\n\nThank you for writing back! No worries regarding coffee, asynchronous works great for me.\n\nI feel pain when I can't easily store and try out many different versions of a sentence. When I build a good tree visualization for DeftDraft it will have navigable revision trees as the fundamental editing concept. \n\nI like Draft but not enough to use it. I like the design of it, but I find linear revision history too constraining. The fact that Nathan, just a few days ago, added \"Duplicate Documents\" so he could have multiple versions of a single document when he writes indicates to me that the linear model restricts writers. I definitely keep tabs on Draft, because as I try to build a Github for Writers I consider Draft as competition. I also keep tabs on PenFlip which I feel takes too much directly from Git to gain traction from non-technical writers.\n\nScrivener feels like too much software for my tastes. It has a lot of interesting features. I want something lighter weight that lives in the browser.\n\nFor my own site I use a wiki engine I wrote that has a few features I regard as mandatory (autocompleting inter-wiki links and returning you to your previous edit position after previewing and general ease of switching between editing and previewing (I don't like live preview as it distracts my eyes)). And of course, tree based revisions. It also helps me write in E-Prime which I enjoy. I keep the code here: https://github.com/zencephalon/zencephalon-mt\n\nI feel very curious about your writing process, as I think you write very well. What programs do you use, and how does your process of ideation proceed? What pain points do you hit? \n\nWhen I watched your recording of \"The Art of Underlining\" I noticed that you tend to revise sentences a few times while writing like I do. With DeftDraft I like to go back and compare the three or four different versions of a sentence I wrote and easily select which one to move forward with.\n\n1:10:00 AM: I feel super productive just now, good stuff.

So far I really enjoy it. It tastes fine, like a really generic protein drink. Preparing my meals for an entire day takes five minutes if I take my time. I just add the powder that comes in a pre-measured sealed pouch to a pitcher, pour in water, and then shake vigorously.\n\nI have reclaimed at least 30 minutes a day where I don't have to think about, look for, or eat food. (If 30 minutes sounds low, have some context: I didn't eat breakfast and ordered Seamless for dinner. Ordering Seamless still takes up too much mental energy, talk about option saturation and analysis paralysis...) Finding lunch in the Financial District struck me as unnecessarily expensive and involved waiting in absurdly long lines. I get to use my entire lunch break as an actual break, rather than a pitstop to maintain the function of my body.\n\nSo far I haven't noticed any differences in physical or mental function. I still follow the same physical practice routine as before, and it doesn't seem much different.\n\nI have produced a lot more intestinal gas lately, especially if I don't make sure to chew the oatmeal grit before I swallow. I read on the Soylent forums that people's gut flora adjusted after about a week. We shall see. I have decided I will just chew my oatmeal grits for now.\n\nI noticed some strange sensations in my head, near the front, that people attribute to an increase in potassium. The first two days on Soylent I definitely did not drink enough water. Since Soylent has both the sodium and potassium recommendations (I previously did not get anywhere near the recommended about of potassium) I need to increase my intake of water.  \n\nI found that just three days in my perspective towards food has shifted dramatically. Little bites of normal food tasted like succulent, bizarre treats. I believe that my body's craving for foods comes from nutritional needs and, indeed, I have found that since starting Soylent I do not crave any foods although I do still enjoy the experience of eating purely for taste. \n\nMy fecal matter has a pleasant consistency to it now, like a soft meat squeezed out of a tube of toothpaste. \n\nI have decided to chew gum so that my jaws do not atrophy from lack of chewing.\n\nI have a one month supply (thanks [David](http://blog.davidad.net/)), with another one on the way so I expect to continue this experiment for quite a while. \n\nPhilosophically I stand behind Soylent 100%. I have no hatred of \"real\" food, but I think that people should have the option to sustain their basic needs for a negligible amount of time and money so that they can invest their full potential into the betterment of humankind.

However, Placebo will take whatever form you find attractive, pleasing, comforting, and amusing. \n\nOf all the gods he has the most evidence supporting his existence. Not only that, but scientists have uncovered ample scientific evidence of his healing powers. In fact, scientists so respect Placebo's healing powers that scientists don't ask, \"do Placebo's healing powers really exist?\" but ask instead \"how can we heal better than Placebo?\" We find it actually really hard to heal better than Placebo! He heals people very well! Scientists really love writing about Placebo.

But Placebo wants us to know that orgasm also feels like the best medicine. And best of all feels laughter during an orgasm.\n\nThe sacred rite of Placebo goes like this: \n\nLoudly intone PLAAAAACEEEEEBOOOOOO and then burst into laughter before lovemaking. \n\nPlacebo likes it when you pet cats. Placebo has imbued the cat's purr with relaxing and healing properties.\n\nPlacebo protects you from illnesses your partner has during the sacred rites of healing. \n\nThe pharmaceutical industry owes a lot to Placebo's miraculous healing powers as do homeopaths. You see, Placebo helps anyone with good intentions heal the sick. Placebo doesn't even care if someone else takes credit for his healing. For example, Placebo will support the effort of faith healers purporting to channel the powers of Jehovah. In surreality, Placebo did it, but he doesn't mind. He does rib Jehovah for it sometimes, because Placebo enjoys playing around and joking.\n\n----\n\nPlaceboism seems like a semi-religion.

Admire the simpleton, enjoying every moment.\n\nEvery piece of the puzzle will fit together, don't create waste by disregarding the importance of the seemingly misfit.\n\nWithin each of us there lies a secret potential, a perfect code for the fullest expression of our innermost selves. \n\nThey are without fears and without desires, dominated by no falsehood, sharing no error, loving without illusion, suffering without impatience, reposing in the quietude of eternal thought... a Magus cannot be ignorant, for magic implies superiority, mastership, majority, and majority signifies emancipation by knowledge. The Magus welcomes pleasure, accepts wealth, deserves honour, but is never the slave of one of them; he knows how to be poor, to abstain, and to suffer; he endures oblivion willingly because he is lord of his own happiness, and expects or fears nothing from the caprice of fortune. He can love without being beloved; he can create imperishable treasures, and exalt himself above the level of honours or the prizes of the lottery. He possesses that which he seeks, namely, profound peace. He regrets nothing which must end, but remembers with satisfaction that he has met with good in all. His hope is a certitude, for he knows that good is eternal and evil transitory. He enjoys solitude, but does not fly the society of man; he is a child with children, joyous with the young, staid with the old, patient with the foolish, happy with the wise. He smiles with all who smile, and mourns with all who weep; applauding strength, he is yet indulgent to weakness; offending no one, he has himself no need to pardon, for he never thinks himself offended; he pities those who misconceive him, and seeks an opportunity to serve them; by the force of kindness only does he avenge himself on the ungrateful...\n\n\"As soon as the steam turns on the engine must run and as soon as things appear before us we must perceive, so a man, to prove the he acts not as a machine must demonstrate that nothing controls him.\"\n\n#### Sketches\n\nMantra Maximum Benefit\n\nThe Manual Benedict means the Book of the Good Word if you trace back the Latin roots.\n\nManual Benedict acts as the main character of the Manual Benedict. He inhabits my fiction-suit in the tradition of Grant Morrison's King Mob.\n\nThrough him I will manifest my will on every plane of existence. As above, so below. As below, so above. Love is the law, love under will. Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.\n\n----\n\nLiberating people motivates Benedict. He will enlighten every person. He choses the path of the boddhisattva. Knowing his rebirth he builds a maximally beneficial world for his next incarnation. \n\n----\n\nManual's memory operates so efficiently that it feels as though he has extrasensory perception. Really his memory just prompts him with the exact information he already knew that he needed exactly then. Although he does also have extrasensory perception. His intuition works so well that he can predict the thoughts of others and preempt them to their wonder. \n\n----\n\n----\n\nManual Benedict has extremely good eyesight, to the point where he does not share all that he sees with people lest they feel disturbed at its acuity. Manual Benedict's eyes did not always  see this well. One night he vowed never to close his eyes to the wonders of the world, and to stand vigilantly in watch for evil and those in need of help. Since that day he has felt changes occurring in his eyes and brain that rapidly brought about changes in his visual acuity. Along with his physical vision improving his third eye has exploded into awareness, allowing him to see auras, energetic phenomena, and subtle interactions. The appearance of Manual Benedict's eyesight can change drastically depending on what he views and the lighting conditions.\n\n----\n\nBenedict's physique resembles that of an athlete, gymnast, or ninja. It looks sleek yet very powerful. The muscles seem built perfectly balanced for poise, flexibility, and readiness. Manual found that as he gradually released the stress from his body he became incredibly flexible to the point where he has to hide his flexibility from people to avoid attention. This flexibility enables him to perform at a high level in climbing and taijutsu. Manual's kundalini acts so powerfully that it allows his body to avoid harm.\n\n----\n\nDue to Benedict's active kundalini his body heals at an accelerated rate, and it constantly undergoes regeneration when food exists plentifully. Using his large reserves of qi, Benedict can survive without food for several weeks at a time. \n\n----\n\nBenedict crafts energy by programming it with his intent. He can create servitors, semi-intelligent agents, and physical effects through his manipulation of energy.\n\n----\n\nManual has extremely good hearing at ranges slightly above and below normal human hearing. \n\n----\n\nBenedict can sense people's motives and knows when they lie. Manual inspires kindness in everyone around him.\n\n----\n\nHis aura looks really extraordinary. It has integrated with his kundalini and acts as a semi-autonomous system that protects, shields, and hides Manual. It can also powerfully project energy, allowing Manual to fill an entire room with a feeling that he wishes to project. For example, he can walk into a lecture hall and fill it with Inspiration as he orates. Generally speaking his aura operates in stealth mode so that he can avoid unwanted attention. To friends and allies it generally appears in its most common form, which looks like a rainbow liquid crystal. The liquid crystalline aura technology allows him great structural strength when necessary and fluid adaptation to whatever environmental and psychic challenges he may face.\n\n----\n\nHis voice sounds smooth and comforting to the ear. When he needs to, he can deliver commands overtly or subliminally with frightening power.\n\n----\n\nManual Benedict prefers lacking enemies to imperviousness to enemies. So while his aura can protect him from harm, he mainly uses it to avoid detection.\n\n----\n\nManual possesses the amazing ability to change his mind to think anything he wants. Whatever he finds most convenient to think at any point in time, he thinks. He has mastered mind like water and can mould his mental process to any situation. \n\n----\n\nManual Benedict thinks very carefully about what he will write next. What he writes has an uncanny way of coming true, especially when he wears his fiction suit and descends into the universe of his own creation. He feels benevolent and tends his universe with the care of a zen gardener. Feeling that every personal universe acts as a mirror of the creator's inner being, he very lovingly looks after his own personal universe. \n\n----\n\nManual Benedict feels cautiously optimistic as he goes out with Tara that they will not get harassed. But he always feels optimistic. Men find Tara so beautiful that she inspires a particular brand of male idiocy.\n\nAs a result, she inevitably gets unwanted attention from boring men. It falls on Manual to give them a clue, a task he takes no delight in. You see, he feels sympathy for the men. He understands what he would do for Tara, and that they would too. \n\nUnfortunately, most men do not take kindly to getting discouraged by a smaller and arguably more handsome man. In their testosterone blinded state they react violently. For this reason Manual feels thankful for his years of dedication to\nTaijutsu. He can disable the unwanted suitors with a carefully calibrated level of pain and humiliation, and never leave a mark. \n\n----\n\nIt looked like one of those days where reality looked too intricately detailed. Ever since he had opened his third eye he would have days like this. Days where if he looked at something for too long, he would begin to notice the details. That nothing seemed truly smooth, every surface looked textured. And the longer he stared the more the illusions of form started to unravel, the more the atomic structures would pop into comprehension. If he stared for a very long time, marveling at the elegance of atomic structures, these too would dissolve into a shifting wave of probability. And then he would have to observe very careful, so that his observations did not inadvertently change the universe he  observed  too drastically.\n\nOn days like this, where he felt wary that he might change reality too much with his gaze, he would turn inward, although that brought him to this state in the first place.\n\n----\n\nManual Benedict made a pact with Toshitugu Takamatsu so that the great warrior's spirit would flow through him as he practiced and performed taijutsu. Manual feels quite pleased with this arrangement. He finds it no pact with the devil, as he finds Takamatsu sensei a benevolent hearted spirit. Regardless of the metaphysical reality of the pact, Manual consistently trains as if possessed by Takamatsu's spirit, causing him to make great progress in perfected subtle movement.\n\n#### Benedictionary\n\n##### A = Aliza\n\nAliza represents the highest conception of the other. I seek to find Aliza in the hearts of everyone I encounter. I seek to treat all I encounter with the respect and reverence and love that I would give Aliza. \n\nAliza acts as my goddess, my holy guardian angel. I trust in her completely. She acts as the Philosopher Queen that counsels and reconciles the many fragmented selves that comprise my self. \n\nA represents the vagina, the mysterious portal, pictorially.\n\n##### B = Benefit\n\nBundays create Benefit. Benefit exists Between two or more people. Benefit and Beauty come hand in hand. \n\nB represents Breasts pictorially. Breasts look Beautiful Because they provide Benefit. \n\n##### C = the Con\n\nThe Condition, the Contract, the Contradiction, the Con. The Socially Constructed world we conned ourselves into. \n\nDone correctly, the Con can become the Com. The Community, the Communication, the Competition. \n\nC represents the Clasped hand pictorially. \n\n##### D = Death\n\n----\n\n#### Solar Plexus\n\nYou drive through any resistance. You see beyond deception.\n\nYou exert assertive intensity. Some would call it exuberance. You feel concerned with the attainment of excellence. You act warm, dynamic and expansive, using your powers of reason to control and manipulate your environment. You do not act aggressively in the hostile sense of needing to dominate, but enjoy the challenge of solving problems and using power. You feel emotionally stable and relaxed physically, developing harmony of mind and body. You have little concern for status and control, as you trust of others. You see yourself as a truth teller and tend to speak strongly and forthrightly which others sometimes perceive as blunt and tactless.\n\nYour enthusiasm draws others to you like moths to the flame so you must take care of your impact as your energy increases. Fire gets associated with charisma or star quality. You find empirical and precise study interesting and may develop into an eloquent and expressive communicator of new and creative ideas. You have to carefully frame your thoughts in ways to make them acceptable to others, as you tend to forget that others do not have your perception of reality as an integrated human. You must act carefully so as to not to fall into paranoia or cynicism.\n\nConcentrate on the center of the spine behind the solar plexus. You can bring up the inner fire by touching the index finder to the thumb, or leaning forward as you step.

I haven't in quite a long time and I think that it has weighed on me for a while now.\n\n10:07:37 PM: Last weekend I tripped, but due to the lack of reflection on the experience you'd hardly think I did. Ohan and Mike showed up and we each dosed about one and a half. Then we went off to the park and played in the fountain for a while. Then we went and climbed a tree, and listened to the piano man. Saw a bit of the pride parade, and ended back at the park to meet up with Daria after she got out of yoga. From there we met up with Jaime in the park. \n\n10:12:05 PM: Anyway, I felt like I haven't learned much from the last few LSD trips I've had, or maybe it hasn't felt as new anymore.

But perhaps I just need some more time to settle into Dev Bootcamp. After all, I still haven't experienced every phase yet, so I still consider myself a new teacher. And I certainly haven't made all the beneficial changes that I would want to make yet. The phase 1 curriculum in particular I need to change up a lot, but I think I could add a lot of value by adding new EE curriculum too. \n\n","name":"0","updated":{"$date":"2014-07-06T02:14:57.464Z"}}

Well, today Daria and I woke up at 7 am! And I think that we might make a habit of it, which I would really dig. I feel slightly bad that I don't have a lecture prepared for this morning, but I feel really excited to see people's demos. Really excited. I think we will find it a lot of fun.\n\n7:36:59 AM: I think I will do the earth invocation from visual magick, and then I will practice San Shin. \n\n7:41:32 AM: Earth invocation went pretty well. Now time to practice some earth kata. I still find chi no kata pretty difficult, but at least I have practiced it once on each side this morning... progress. I actually can't believe how little I have practiced lately. I need to get back in the groove. I will practice rocking back and forth between ichimonji and tsuki a bunch of times. \n\n7:59:07 AM: Also practiced standing in hicho for a while. Pretty good workout, that. Wow, still three minutes before I would normally wake up. I wonder how I will feel during the day. Might take a nap during lunch, nbd. \n\n10:49:51 AM: Nice bit of yoga this morning. Almost nobody showed up, just Whitney, Danielle, Vic, and Lloyd. We did a bunch of great hip and leg stretches. \n\n10:50:31 AM: Lectured on dotenv files briefly and talked about Sailthru's security setup and the problems it had. Felt a bit disappointed by the feedback report this week, because it seems like all of the feedback from my L-word EE session didn't get included, and instead I got to read a really negative piece of feedback targeted at Katie. Definitely a bit unfair. I think people should not externalized their failures and place the blame on other people. \n\n9:16:59 PM: Good time at class. Reviewed those seminar techniques that we did on Sunday. Bo technique from chu-dan, wrist exposed to their attack from seigan. As they attack the wrist, drop forward to receive the blade. After matching the blade in warrior's chair pose, tsuki with the front leg to reverse sides and attack. Sword technique. Start from geidan, they tsuki from seigan. Receive the blade in warrior's chair pose, tsuki with the front leg to reverse sides and end in reversed tsuki. \n\n9:46:29 PM: Starting both in shizen, shift to ichimonji in the ura-gyaku direction. You do not gyaku with the hand, but just guard. Other arm comes up to strike the side and knock them to the side too. Hand that came up comes up to sui-sto as the body twists further into an omote-gyaku shape, then curls around the neck as the body twists further. Then strike the face as you shift forward into tsuki on the line formed by their head and your foot. \n\n9:49:31 PM: Starting with him grabbing you, shift to ichimonji in the ura-gyaku direction. You do not gyaku with the hand, but just guard. Other arm comes up to strike/press their collarbone on the same side that grabs you. Their lower back should feel stressed, your weight should press into them so that they cannot kick you. \n\n9:51:06 PM: All of these movements have the theme of making initial contact (matching) and then suddenly dropping your weight into it and knocking them away. I have yet to understand this. \n\n9:44:21 PM: Alright, going to try this after I finish journaling taijutsu and I drink some water. I hope to contact my holy guardian angel, but I will remain open to any and all experiences that bring me closer to an understanding of my place in the universe. \n\n10:36:37 PM: I feel absolutely elated right now. I feel so glad and so grateful and so fucking thankful that DMT exists. I feel that it IS my spiritual ally, that through it I can become a SHAman. That I can use it to guide people to better lives, that I can use it to fully become myself, to manifest all of my inborn potentials. That I can work with the spirits of this molecule to bring conscious evolution to humanity so that we can all join together in peace and prosperity.

I managed to make it through the day, although I did end up yawning a bunch while students asked me questions, which I felt a bit rude about. Also, the twitter API has a bunch of little caveats, as does deploying to Heroku, so I didn't really enjoy that. Did enjoy meeting John and talking about Oculus with him, since it turns out he has the original oculus dev kit.\n\n8:49:01 PM: Good taijutsu class today with Cameron, James, and Andy. Andy showed a lot of improvement today in terms of basics, although he still doesn't know how to move. But he did the first part of omote gyaku pretty well. For myself, I still have to work on the turn part of omote. We worked on uke and tsuki today and some taisabaki too. No major breakthroughs, but I did notice (thanks Cameron) that I have a tendency to lean over when doing tsuki to avoid a sword strike, and that puts me off balance to my back, so I need to work on that. And James pointed out that I begin the movement by shifting all my weight to one leg, and that I should try to do the movement without that tell, it changes the whole way the initialization goes. I will have to practice that. \n\n8:52:16 PM: Might not get a good chance to try some more DMT today, but I don't mind. Didn't feel so great about Soylent today, I think I will probably go back to eating normal food when my Soylent runs out, as I have a pretty good sense for what I need to eat and I trust that more than some government guidelines for nutrition. If anything, I can imagine that the goverment created those guidelines to make the average American diet SEEM normal, even though in natural reality they feel way out of whack. \n\n8:53:44 PM: Got a really nice reply from George today, that made me feel good about him and Sailthru. The biggest sticking points I have about going back include: that I love my job right now, and that I won't have much time to go back home unless I push my start date back a bit so I have a bit of a break between jobs. Also I don't know if I should keep two jobs at once... that feels like the ninja thing to do but also maybe wrong ethically. I probably wouldn't do that. But maybe I would. \n\n8:54:54 PM: Tomorrow I will meet David at Dev Bootcamp, I think I will find that interesting. I feel really sad that the cicadas will leave on Friday, and I won't get to see a lot of them again, but hopefully we can all stay in touch and our paths can cross in the future. I don't know. I think that maybe after I have gone through two cohorts I won't feel quite as driven as I do now. I don't know, I feel that I don't do well at predicting my future emotions.\n\n8:56:14 PM: I would like for dinner to arrive as I feel quite hungry, and I would like to go to bed sooner than I did yesterday. I think that I will blow off Aditya, because frankly, everything just feels so difficult with him. I offered to have him come over and smoke up and he said that he would feel claustrophobic in this apartment. Maybe the way he had it arranged, with terribly Feng Shui it felt claustrophobic, but I have arranged this apartment in a far superior manner with a lot of open space, so I find that pretty laughable, but he doesn't know that because he hasn't came here since he moved out, and frankly I don't really see any reason for him to. I don't particularly care to play Magic with him as I know that my deck will simply wipe the floor with him, and each time we play I have to carefully engineer the game so that he always has a way to win, without it appearing too obvious that I threw the game.

Although I feel really happy that she feels so caught up in the enthusiasm of hacker school. I don't know. \n\n8:57:52 PM: Interesting day for me today. I really enjoyed meeting David Haber this afternoon and hearing his story of working at SPARC capitol, founding Bond Street. Hiring his friend Payton. He went to Harvard, graduate in 2009 I think? Went to a public high school with a crazy high student ratio. His mom taught though. Bond Streets makes small business loans way easier, and awesome. They got a really great financial analyst from a big bank. They have just two engineers right now. Steve and Peyton. They work out of 22nd st. They have six people right now. They raised a seedround, and they made a $150,000 loan to everlane. Their first loan ever. Everlane has an interesting business model. They built the sites for Warby Parker and Harry's, and they took a lot of equity. Creates great alignment. Normally a small business loan takes 6 weeks to get. Fail. Small business lending has decreased 25% since the financial crisis. \n\nHey David,\n\nI really enjoyed meeting you this afternoon and hearing your story of working at Spark Capital, founding Bond Street. Thank you for sharing your educational background too, I always enjoy learning about how people learn. Your mom sounds like an awesome teacher. \n\n22nd St. doesn't sound too out of the way for me, comparable to my current commute, so I'd enjoy meeting Peyton, Steve, Jerry, Eddie, and Jeremy too and see if all mesh.\n\nCongratulations on making your first loan, and thanks for the background on small business lending. It really blew me away to hear you say that small business lending had dropped by around 25% since the financial crisis.\n\nI wouldn't mind coming by your office sometime soon.

Feel pretty good about the productivity I've had so far. Want to journal some more though and get really clear.

Meant a lot coming from Josh. I think I want to train a lot harder now. Today in class we continued to work on the techniques from Paris seminar. The bo technique against the exposed wrist, the equivalent sword technique. Then we did the taijutsu movement with the omote-gyaku-esque strike that rapidly turns into a sto and around the neck grab into a punch. \n\n9:15:14 PM: Ugh, feel pretty horny today. Part of me just wants to watch some porn, but I'd rather see Daria. But she doesn't happen to have come home yet. Meh. I will go smoke some DMT now.\n\n9:15:41 PM: Also I did call my mom for her birthday.

I don't really enjoy going to gyms, although the last tanren class I went to did teach me a lot. \n\nI came up with a schedule for HOPE X today so I enjoyed doing that. \n\nTough conversation today with the woodchucks, about the division that had formed in our cohort.

I gave Brendan a copy of the kama sutra and Understanding Reality, which I hope he will enjoy.\n\nOf course, I really enjoyed the game house trip and haven't had time to reflect on that.

I see plagiarism as an excellent means of transmission. My ideas will have greater impact if people hear them from a variety of different sources. Should you choose to steal my ideas you should most definitely claim that you invented them. In that way the ideas will seem more commonplace and easier to accept.\n\nI believe that our ideas have a greater life than ourselves. Richard Dawkins helpfully pointed out that ideas carry all the signs of life, and I consider them a more evolved life form. We should not keep our ideas under lock and key, we should allow them to roam free. My ego should not interfere with the spread of my own ideas.\n\nTaking this stance does, however, encourage my own individuality and total expression. If I write in a way that people find unmistakably distinct and true to me, then even if people plagiarize me, people will always know that I birthed such ideas. But I find this a minor benefit. I chiefly aim for my ideas to disseminate widely, and you can help me, and make yourself look better by taking any idea of mine that strikes your fancy.\n\nI consider the most influential people those whose sayings we have so heavily plagiarized that we consider their thoughts \"idioms\", common expressions that we hear so often we take them as truth. \n\nI want [lovers](lovism) everywhere. I want [nuddhists](nuddhism) everywhere. I care not whether people remember me. \n\nI do not consider this a radical stance.

Daria has gone home to see her mom, and I hope she has a great time there.\n\nInteresting tarot reading today. A whole lot of wands, and the Princess of Wands. I wonder who she represents. I feel like I wanted to ask about my career but really ended up asking about something else. I got the hermit and the ace of wands among the more notable cards. Also ruin, the 10 of swords. \n\nI had a surprisingly easy interview with Genius today, but it seems like Mat Brown liked me already, so he went pretty easy. I learned about max_by, which I really love. Ruby really has some great stuff built in to the standard library. I didn't get a chance to practice taijutsu today which I feel bad about. \n\nToday talking to Brandon made me feel slightly insecure about how little sparing we do, but I don't know if I should really feel that way. They spar, but they have a lot of rules about what they can and can't do that just don't apply to ninjas. So I don't know if I really find it a fair comparison. I do think I might enjoy also going to a BJJ gym, though.\n\nHad dinner with people from DBC after the DBCx event. Had a nice time talking to Courtney and Kimberly and Erin, and to a lesser extent to Brandon and Jen. I talked about my vision for Athena to handle communication within a tribe.\n\nStill felt really tired today, hoping I can catch up on sleep tonight, but I need to get to bed soon to do so.\n\nGenius has worked on a lot of ideas I have, so I think we will have some interesting topics of conversation to go over. Like they really have worked on problems that I have too, and interestingly I think I might have some better solutions than they do on certain problems, so I find that pretty interesting. I will love to see what they get up to. I think the commute might prove difficult, but I wouldn't mind getting $1k cash from them and a better number to take to Sailthru, although the rest of the perks at genius sound pretty nice, Sailthru has nice perks too. Especially how close Sailthru gets.\n\nGoing to meet with Payton from Bond St tomorrow so I think that will prove interesting. And then straight off to hope. I think I should find some electronic way to present my tickets so I don't have to print them.\n\nVivek has hooked me up with his ayahausca circle, which I feel really excited about. It sounds like they really take the spiritual side of it seriously. I can pay for it with the LSD money I got from Dinesh. \n\nOkay, I think I've probably done enough journaling for tonight.\n\nOh yeah, I want to work on craftycritiquer some more now that I actually know how to use Rails, or at least Sinatra. Really shouldn't prove too difficult, and I would find it a great tool to have. So yeah, I should work on that and Reader.\n\n8:49:59 AM: Strange and interesting dreams this morning. Dreamed that police came and forcibly removed Daria and I from our small apartment, and we had to move a few blocks down... into a larger apartment, so that worked out pretty well in our favor. Plus we moved right next to Wiley. I looked through someone's photo album and they had a lot of really sexy photos in it. Some kind of game we played. Kitkat and a collection of little knickknacks. Doing some kind of assessment in Chinese. My family showed up. Getting high with Steve Gattuso at his apartment. Eating dinner at Wiley's apartment with Aidan and a WHOLE bunch of interesting old people who all introduced themselves to me really rapidly. A bookshelf full of interesting books on magic and martial arts, and the owner of the apartment showing me kindness. \n\n9:05:32 AM: Did Dr. Morris's KAP yesterday night. Had a good time doing it, felt really good. This time when it came to concentrating on the root chakra I took that to mean try to get the stiffest erection possible. I got pretty far. It seems that I should learn how to have an erection at will, and probably how to shrink an erection at will, that way I will have mastered my libido. \n\n9:06:52 AM: In my dreams I really liked the photos I saw in the album, they had a strong impression on me. I don't know who the photos had the likeness of, I don't think I've met them. \n\nI really enjoy having the word counter actually working now. I think that if I can get to say, 300,000 words written all in E-Prime then I will have a pretty good grasp on it. And if I keep mentally enunciating what I write, then I will have a lot of practice avoiding using E-Prime in my thoughts. Then hopefully it will translate into my speech and I can avoid using \"is\". Jen used a lot of \"is\" in her talk yesterday and she sounded very confused logically at a lot of points, which I find understandable... using \"is\" for non-magical purposes can do that to a person. Although in fairness to her, she did try to use it magically, from what I could tell. The delivery just didn't quite cut it that time. ","name":"2","updated":{"$date":"2014-07-18T13:09:17.946Z"}}
,{"_id":"3rL3PqCnpr5sse6w9","active":true,"url":"VR","prose":"EoKdgX8fYuycMmimG","text":"First of all, I think VR will mostly obsolete our current conception of money. Right now in developed nations, after paying for our daily sustenance, the majority of our income goes towards experiences. What do I mean by 'experiences'? Going to eat a new food, see a show, travel, etc. We pay money in order to enrich the experience of our existence with novel stimuli. Once we have access to sufficiently life-like VR the costs of such experiences will dramatically plummet, and with it we will have to rethink and restructure our societies and economies.\n\nI think we will eventually adopt a currency based on processing power and time in VR. The transition to this sort of Timecoin will feel pretty easy once we have adapted to crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin. \n\nI think crypto-currencies represent the future of currency, and have already invested significantly in Bitcoin. Thinking about the future of VR I have also decided to invest in Facebook, as I believe Oculus will prove enormous for them. I currently await the arrival of my Oculus development kit.\n\nI think Facebook has at best a limited future as an advertising platform (I can't help but wish to hasten advertising towards its death) but I think as a provider of virtual reality environments it holds a potentially amazing future. Using some sort of Facetime (too bad Apple took that one, eh Facebook?) to hangout with friends from across the world in what feels like physical proximity seems like an exciting prospect.\n\nBut I find that a totally mundane idea for using VR. The future of gaming will explode with possibility. Imagine flying through space with your friends as you explore realms previously accessible only to lucid dreams and psychedelic shamans. \n\nOr Facebook could get really creepy and release something like [Facefuck](facefuck). The implications of VR for porn will prove profound, I think. Many avenues for enterprising people there. \n\nI would want VR tech to exist as open source software. I would find it a huge shame if a single company held a monopoly on VR tech. I can easily imagine that devolving into a dystopia wherein everyone works for The Corporation that can grant them access to their dreams, but for a price. And you can only dream sanctioned dreams that the Oversight Board of Morality deem appropriate. Black markets abound with forbidden VRs to use with hijacked tech. VR creation limited to an elite group of artists that promote The Corporation's aesthetic of mindlessly materialistic simulations. Millions of souls crushed by a banal existence where they labor by day and night just to gain access to intellectually retarding VRs with titles like: _Buffet Bonanza 17: Seafood Edition_, _Fast, Fast Cars VII_, and _Big Tit Orgy XI_. \n\nMuch better to imagine a world with open source VR. Where anyone who can imagine can create aVR. Where we pool together our resources and provide a VR environment that any member of the human family has access to. Where we can ascend to creative godhood in the realms of our creation.\n\nSome people wonder if we will invent anything after VR. I think that assumes that _everyone_ will want to degenerate into pleasure seeking escapism. I believe that a lot of people will still gain the most pleasure from invention and innovation. Those people will probably use VR to create labs where they can create prototypes. If anything, I expect the level of technology to explode after the invention of VR.  \n\nI hope that once we have open source virtual reality, humanity's greatest minds will work together to solve basic problems like energy and food so that the vast majority of humans can dedicate their existences to fulfilling their creative potentials of self-expression.\n\nOf course, as Utopian as everyone living in VR sounds to me, I think we will encounter many difficult issues of governance. For instance, how to share computational power. Different simulations will have different power requirements. Perhaps everyone should get an equal share of power, but have the choice to donate some of theirs to other people. I say this because I imagine that certain scientists might wish to run massive simulations that require a lot of power, and people should have the ability to fund such endeavorers if they wish to. \n\nSome people will wish to play war games. And I have no opposition to that so long as everyone participates willingly.  \n\n[BB] One thing I should mention here is that VR does not have the ability to hurt us, which in some respects makes it inferior (or superior, depending on one's perspective) to real life. As long as being harmed in the digital world is limited to emotional harm, VR will always have a rather large diff in comparison to the physical world. \n","name":"6","updated":{"$date":"2014-07-18T15:09:59.403Z"}}

I think we had a good conversation. Honestly it didn't seem like they had much going on in terms of tech. Just a lot of Django. I don't think I can get very enthusiastic about the programming challenges there, although I did think that the architecture for long term scaling held some interesting possibilities.

Heard about mesh networks in NYC. \n\nAnyway!\n\nToday I climbed a tree.\n\nI learned a lot from it, which I had hoped to compose into some sort of epic tale, though I find that the learnings from it will take a while to digest. \n\nI think Linus must have some profound wisdom though, because it seems to me that he really grokked the tree metaphor. \n\nI think I learned to feel chi and energy, and I felt like I benefitted the tree from climbing it. I would like to give the tree a name, or I should really ask its name. I found it a very wise and caring spirit and I will think fondly of it always.

I still believe this is the most effective form of self defense an average person can learn easily. Someone wants to beat you up? Run away.\n\nThat said, a couple months ago I began training in a real combative martial art. I took it up for reasons of fascination and interest. As I was confronted by the reality of just how brutal many of these techniques are I had to ask myself, really, why am I learning this? I never want to use any of these techniques on a person outside of a training environment. That would be awful.\n\nI have come to realize that while running away is an amazing defense strategy for me, because I sprint so very fast, it won’t work for everyone. I want to travel the globe with my friends and lovers, and when they are threatened then I’ll have to stand my ground. I can’t assume that we will all be able to run out of the situation.\n\nTo that end, then, I’m learning how to defend myself and other in armed and unarmed combat. I’ve come to appreciate that the better my technique the less harm I’ll have to inflict to neutralize a dangerous situation. Before my training if I had to fight the only techniques I could rely on are to punch and kick. Subduing an enemy with blunt force trauma alone is not pretty, and certain to leave injuries. That is not what I want. Instead I would prefer to use painful but not actually harmful locks to disable an attacker. Better to leverage some skillful pain compliance until they either submit or faint than to cause permanent damage, in my opinion.","name":"1","updated":{"$date":"2014-07-25T00:08:58.959Z"}}

I think I would like to work on the word counter and the focus colors now, so I will do that. \n\nCool, so now I have private prose and autosave indication, so I think I will find this pretty awesome. I think that I will like to keep working on this. I feel pretty good about the progress I've made so far.\n\n4:44:54 PM: I feel slightly put upon today, because Lloyd straight up told me that leaving DBC would put it in a really bad place, mostly because of shit getting fucked up that has nothing to do with me. According to him we have low morale. I think that out of the goodness of my heart I will stay here though, and I will learn to master the heart chakra through this experience. Certainly I know that I could become a better teacher, and I do believe that teaching suites my demeanor. I think that I will have to get a lot better at my job so that I feel more comfortable with it. And I want to figure out some way that I can work fewer hours and that would involve working on my own projects while at DBC, which I think I could pull off. \n\n5:13:43 PM: Anyway, obviously I just have to learn how to hack this place more. Like using the fact that I will have a lot of capable students that I can farm off freelance projects to. And using DBC as a way to get my friends speaker engagements. And using it as a publicity machine. I can definitely get a lot of value out of DBC. But I wouldn't mind working at Genius, obviously. \n\n5:15:57 PM: Anyway, I would enjoy getting a lot done here and making a life out of this, so I guess I should figure out how to do it and make it work and not give up because it gets hard. Same deal with Daria, if I wait it out then life will reward me handsomely. \n\n11:48:21 PM: Well. I guess I made it. Long day for me. Glad that I could connect with Dylan though. And give Kimberly a hug, since she clearly really needed it. And I introduced myself to that lady in the orange dress in Chinese which I really enjoyed. So I pushed my limits today. I feel like I really helped out a lot of people and I think I just need to get positive and get off to a good start. I feel a bit stretched and I feel bad that I didn't get to take the call with Colleen, but maybe I should just let her know that I don't have any interest in Palantir anymore.","name":"7","updated":{"$date":"2014-07-25T14:38:40.211Z"}}

I hope that you will appear in BHD soon and I will meet you. Today I felt sad. I found out that Daria doesn't even tell people about hackNY and I found that rather strange. And so people didn't have any background on how we met or anything. I just felt like all of my students know her, but none of her hackerschool friends know me and I find that imbalance kind of weird. Anyway, maybe the spell will work and she will fall in love with the right person for her, because I don't think I really fit her personality exactly right and then I could meet you. I feel willing to make that exchange. Of course I love her and I wouldn't want her to feel any pain so I want her to find her true love. I would feel very happy for her.\n\n9:52:07 PM: I don't know what to do about feeling trapped at DBC, because I do. I felt a bit sad that Daria didn't come to the event at DBC. But okay. I shouldn't let that bug me. A lot of coaches have questions for me and I found that lots of students did too and I just don't know what to do, I feel so put upon some days like everyone wants a piece of me. But what about me? What about what I want? I thought I wanted to help people, but I have to ask myself, help people do what? I guess I don't really know what I need to feel happy. Just myself and to meditate perhaps. I must seek the happiness within. But I would find it so much easier if I had you by my side, and I will hold out my hope for you and I will continue to work as well as I can to act as well as I can so that one day I will feel worthy of you and the universe will bring you into my orbit and we can become a two body system. I hope you understand the way I feel right now because I really need a kindred soul to navigate this crazy world with and sometimes I just feel so alone in this world. I would love to have someone who felt as good as me about helping people and we could work together as a kickass team to help the world get better.\n\n10:15:34 PM: I wish I knew when Daria will get home. Not that I know what difference it would make when she does. I don't know. I feel hungry but also not hungry. I don't know exactly what to do, maybe practice taijutsu a bit and refactor my blog some.

Had some ginger by accident. Had some spicy food for lunch by accident. Had sex with Daria five hours before hand. And I ate some dinner. But overall, I think I did make an effort to follow the guidelines, and I hope to make some spiritual breakthroughs today. I felt happy to hear that Raghav felt like he moved towards inner peace today after tripping, I felt really happy to hear that actually. I rested a lot in the afternoon in preparation for this. Dreamed about playing MtG against Rebecca with my brothers and Andy. I read this strange rules text that said magic required you to wear a certain watch in order to keep time, and the card has something to do with physical time. Very strange. Rebecca played a 15/15 indestructable, one of those big dudes from that one set with all the big dudes so we started to conspire to gang up on her.

Because our posture and breathing are intimately related to how we ‘feel’ emotionally. When we are stressed our muscles tighten, we breath shallowly and from the chest, our body closes up. The way to relax and feel better is just to notice this happening, and consciously choose to open up our posture again and breathe deeply. Most people are too focused on what they are stressing over to notice their bodies, and hence don’t know how to relieve their stress.\n\nBy making a conscious effort to practice mindfulness for a few months we become intimately aware of our emotional reactions to events, and are able to consciously counteract stressors. Eventually it becomes automatic and you find that you are relaxed and standing with good posture everywhere. And you’ll also see people around you who are stressed, the signs are easy to see once you see them within yourself.\n\nThis practice is doubly effective, because it allows you to stop thinking about something that is stressing you. If I tell most people not to think of a laughing green buddha they usually struggle with it for a while, until they go do something else and naturally forget about it. The problem is obvious, you can’t stop thinking about something by thinking that you want to stop it. Instead, you have to find something else to do with complete attention.\n\nBy practicing focusing on the breath overtime we establish strong pathways in our brains associated with the breath. This makes it very easy to come to breath and stay there, it becomes easier and easier to concentrate on over time. This establishes the breath as an ‘anchor’ in the mind, a reliable place you know you can come to when you want to forget something else.\n\nNext time someone tries to be a smart ass and tell you not to think of red space missionaries, just return to your breathing.\n\nAll of this establishes a solid foundation from which you can branch off into more advanced meditation techniques.","name":"1","updated":{"$date":"2014-07-29T23:23:34.390Z"}}

We went over the san-shin, of course. Did some tsuki and uke, from shizen, which I always find useful. Hard to do an effective uke when Andy and Will can hardly tsuki, but I don't mind. I did what Josh said to do and just practiced my own form without worrying about what they could do, because they obviously where not able to hit me. We practiced ura gyaku a bit, which I found really helpful. I think I made some progress on it. Specifically, when it comes to the elbow on the movement with the cross step I realized that I can let my elbow go much higher, because I want it to look like daijodan. \n\n11:22:36 PM: I feel excited to meet the guy from KAP, since he has helped Dr. Morris so much.

I dreamed that I went over to Andy's apartment and we did drugs together. I dreamed that I ate dinner with my family and Haresh came over as a house guest except I never saw him because he stayed in the bathroom all the time. I dreamed that I got into an argument with my parents because of catholicism. We talked about the transubstantiation of wafer into christ's flesh. For some reason. I don't know why it got so heated, but the last thing I remember before waking involved yelling about the wafers. \n\n11:06:48 AM: Kitkat pooped outside of his litterbox again, and I almost stepped on it. Seems like he has swallowed a bunch of hair or string or something because he has stringy stuck together poops.\n\n11:07:21 AM: Had a good talk with Daria last night. I feel like when we get kind of horny and fidgety at night maybe we should just make love, because otherwise it feels like we never get to sleep until past 1.\n\n11:10:11 AM: Wiki seems to work pretty well... But I do need to track down this weird bug that keeps sending me to the bottom of my text.\n\n12:04:32 PM: So the soylent I made today failed completely. I didn't add enough powder and right now it just tastes like gross tasting water. So basically wasted. I guess I still have to make it in the big container or something. I think I will need to buy lunch today, sadly I don't have any cash anymore. I want to go home and play with my sword. Finding today rather boring.\n\n7:45:56 PM: So today... interesting day I guess. Got lunch with the ReadyReader team at a nice little deli and ate by the waterside. I enjoyed that. Had a difficult conversation with Lloyd, but I feel like I understand and trust his motivations better now. I think that I will probably stay at Dev Bootcamp, but I still want to get the job at Genius so that I can present that to my students and let them know that I really bring it.\n\n9:04:49 PM: Had a good conversation with Daria today. She had a good time at Dev Bootcamp, and actually had a conversation with Dan from Thinkful today. ","name":"4","updated":{"$date":"2014-08-01T01:05:10.193Z"}}

Portentous yijing today about it. \n\n64. Wei Chi / Before Completion -\u003e   20. Kuan / Contemplation\n\nSeems like Genius will fit right into my life path moving forward. I expect to receive an offer, as I feel like the interviews went great and Andrew mentioned next steps and that they moved quickly. I expect to resign from Dev Bootcamp soon, which works well since it seems like I will not get to cohort lead again for at least 9 weeks, during which time I would have to teach phase 2 over and over, something I do not particularly relish.\n\n10:48:13 PM: Good class today with Cameron and Andy. Andy still has weird form, but I think a lot of our problems with him happen because he looks a lot taller and we need to actually not drop as low in order to affect him. We did some ura-gyaku and I think I made a little progress, although not a lot. At least, I made progress on Cameron's easier version. And we did a lot of uke practice along with some tai-sabaki. I think I would like to play with my sword tonight after I finish writing about the last few days.\n\n11:21:01 PM: Just had amazing intercourse with Daria. :)\n\n11:21:17 PM: So graduation felt really satisfying, and particularly the angel tunnel, but I don't know if I can keep doing it over and over. I felt like it really took a lot out of me the last time around, although the pay off did feel really worthwhile, but I don't think I would enjoy teaching as much if I didn't get to cohort lead and it seems like Sam really wants to cohort lead the mud turtles, when I would also really like to cohort lead the mud turtles, so given all the other turmoil around DBC and the fact that the admissions numbers have dropped so much I think I might just take the Genius road. Assuming I get an offer from them, which I really expect that I will.\n\nI did have a great time with John and Kai and really enjoyed introducing them to the kundalini awakening process meditation and watching Tron Legacy with them.\n\n11:54:20 PM: Did a bunch of koho seigan nuki and tsuki with my sword today, still haven't given it a cool name but I will.","name":"5","updated":{"$date":"2014-08-06T03:54:39.936Z"}}

Just wanted to write down that I dreamed very extensively of magic. I dreamed about a Green/White creature that had \"+1/+1 for each forest or plains you control\". Interestingly my mind seems to generate very plausible random magic cards, and I can even read the text of them in my dreams, they even have plausible looking art and flavor text. Seems as though I have all too many magic cards bouncing around in my brain if I could just make them up like that.\n\n8:25:10 PM: Well, I don't really know what happened, but it seems like I didn't get the Genius job, although they provided no feedback whatsoever on why not. I feel so confused because yesterday I felt so confident that I did in fact get the job, but it seems like I didn't. I don't know what the hell to think. I guess I just need to forget about it then. I did have a bunch of reasons why that didn't happen to represent the ideal working situation for me for example the length of the commute.\n\nI think I will practice some tsuki to work out some frustration.\n\n8:38:50 PM: Well, my plan to setup the rolling chair as a target for tsuki did not work so great. I think I should get a proper punching bag at some point. Since I felt frustrated I decided to take the trash out and do the dishes so at least something productive would happen.\n\n8:39:23 PM: At least I wrote to Ethan and he seemed very happy with my proposal, although we haven't talked about pricing yet. I still have to follow up with Tim.\n\n8:43:15 PM: Well, I texted Tim.\n\n8:43:19 PM: Anyway, today's mysterious meeting at DBC left me feeling pretty upset. Apparently Tanner will leave at the end of August. I felt like Tanner represented one of the few bright points of working at DBC. Well, not one of the few, I find several or many bright points, but he certainly had a huge role in attracting me to work at DBC and I feel like his lost represents a huge blow. And then after that finding out that I didn't get the Genius offer kind of sucked. But on the plus side, it sounds like Morgante wants to get me an offer to work at Cafe.com so that could work out well. I don't really know what to do with myself. Right now I feel especially trapped at DBC, but I almost can't do anything useful because I have this NT time. I suppose I should use this time to work on the EE curriculum and phase 2 curriculum.\n\n8:45:15 PM: I had a nice conversation with Anna, she sounded quite interested in Cafe.com. I wonder what Maya told her about me. We had a good conversation. I guess she grew up in New York as a kid, her parents had her in China. She just graduated from HBS and has been working with a guy involved with Gilt, MongoDB, and Business Insider. \n\n8:48:59 PM: Josh asked today if something heavy happened in my life, he said \"your energy feels different today\". Very interesting. We practiced musha-dori today, which I still find very difficult, but I made some progress today. At the end of the movement one must move their elbow away from their body. On the cross step we must take their balance so that they fall into the lock. Difficult, but doable with some flow.\n\n8:50:18 PM: I wish Daria right now, I could definitely use some emotional support. Maybe I will download some movies for us to watch while she has yoga.\n\n9:14:47 PM: Did a whole bunch of koho seigan nuki and tsuki and now I feel a bit better. I have to act carefully when practicing while upset though. Earlier in class I whacked myself on the right temple with the bo, and today I hit myself right across the face while drawing my katana. Lucky that it didn't have a sharp edge or I might have given myself a nasty scar. Ah well. Lesson learned, I have to keep my head on the line. I feel as though I have to practice a lot more bojutsu, as that represents a major weakness in my practice. Interestingly Josh says that he has a weakness with bojutsu too.\n\n9:16:18 PM: I really dig this jazzy hop playlist on soundcloud, that definitely makes me feel better, I love soundcloud. I feel a bit hot now, so I think I will take my clothes off again.\n\n9:23:47 PM: Did some pullups and pushups. I feel really impressed with Adam that he managed to pull off a one armed pushup. Also he got a job as the first engineering employee at a startup, super awesome for him! looks like he won't stay on as a teacher at DBC. Did a bit of yoga too, for that matter. I could probably do with more stretching in my life, and improving my typing posture while at my standing desk.","name":"3","updated":{"$date":"2014-08-07T01:24:51.527Z"}}
,{"_id":"o8r2CXsBGv67tZGSp","active":true,"url":"writing_to_myself","prose":"mjDx8FvWs4e558aZA","text":"Dear Matt,\n\nU should write to Urself. Why? Because U often get hung up on what Ur audience will think, and it prevents U from writing and truly expressing Urself. But U know what U want to read, so when U write to Urself, U  truly release Ur creativity. Plus, when U write to Urself, U can instruct Urself in the way U think U should live. Since U know how U want to live, U don't need all these complicated arguments and theories about why U should live that way, U just need to tell Urself and U will do it.\n\nWriting to Urself effectively self-hypnotizes U. Just think, U find enormous meaning in writing. U really take the written word seriously and believe that it can guide U to act better. So why not write to Urself and create the words U wish to live by? A sound principle, right?\n\nWhen U write to Urself U feel no pressure, because only U will read it. U could publish what U write to Urself, but U shouldn't care what other people think, because U don't consider them Ur intended audience. \n\nGreat writers often say in order to write well U must know Ur audience. Well, U know Urself, so Ur writing will sound great to U. In a mystical sense, which U know U love, to know Urself truly means knowing others too, because fundamentally we share the human experience. U know that U had trouble loving and expressing Ur love for people before U learned to love Urself. How could U give to another person what U thought U did not deserve? When U learned to love Urself, then U also learned to love others. And what a difference it has made in Ur life, has it not?\n\nSo along similar lines, once U have learned to write for Urself, U will also have learned to write for others. And how wonderful U will feel. When U can stir the emotions in Ur own heart, when U can instill hope and excitement in Urself, then how could U not do so in another? Just think of all the wondrous stories U can weave to inspire children to make the world a better place, the thoughtful philosophical novels that explore the depths of the human experience, rousing popular opinion pieces that influence the public to see things in a new light, clear and concise instruction manuals to help people change their lives with practical skills. U can do all that, but U have to practice, and U have to start somewhere. Starting with Urself takes off all the pressure. Why would U judge Urself for what U have written to Urself? U would only defeat Urself by doing so. \n\nU can't bullshit Urself. So when U write to Urself, U write without artifice and with nothing to hide. Why do U write to Urself? U already know. Hopefully Ur motives feel good, because U treat Urself well.\n\nWriting to Urself feels easy, because U don't have to worry about logical progressions between one thought and the next. It makes sense to U, because U just meandered to a new topic, and U don't care where thing head. Writing to Urself feels fun because U can come up with many astounding ideas without worrying about perception.\n\nWriting to Urself feels a little different than writing to Ur diary.\n\nWrite to Urself everyday, because U will love it. U want to write, U've just felt shy about expressing Urself in the past. U have a lot of soul, and U can get comfortable with sharing that by first sharing it with Urself. Write to Urself everyday, and the words will become malleable as putty. As U write to Urself everyday U may notice a sense of ease and eloquence in Ur composition. In the days and weeks ahead U may find great enjoyment in writing to Urself everyday. People can, U know, write to themselves everyday, and in doing so gain great practice in writing.","name":"3","updated":{"$date":"2014-08-08T03:30:20.523Z"}}

I guess I helped Joel get his environment setup with some migrations, and I shared the interview problems from Genius with my woodchucks, so that all felt good. But I also took a nap in the middle of the day, and before that I had a lot of trouble even waking up in the morning in time to meet with Adrian from VentureAssembly. \n\n11:03:05 PM: Okay, so today ended up feeling pretty good. I have really enjoyed reading the book by Santiago Dobles and Tao Semko called 'Secrets the Gurus will never share' about kundalini awakening. So far it has a lot of great info that I have corroborated with Dr. Morris's research. I registered for the KAP class today in October, which I really look forward. Thanks to Daria I had the time to register for that, because it turns out they had a bug in their checkout system that caused it to report that they had already sold out when in fact they didn't. So I registered early and got the class for just $400. I feel excited to meet with Tao and have my interview with him and review any course materials I get before the workshop.\n\n11:04:52 PM: I had amazing sexual intercourse with Daria today. We both came one after the other, and it felt really good. I have improved a lot in giving head, as has she. Our foreplay has really improved recently and we can consistently forgo having to use any lubrication as she has gotten very wet for me recently. Good times all around.\n\n11:11:49 PM: I think I might just stick at Dev Bootcamp and get really good at Ruby and at Meditation and teach both to everyone that I get to encounter. I think since DBC has fairly high tolerance for my eccentricities I could totally just use it as my base for becoming enlightened. I know I tried to have this attitude before with Sailthru but I think I could truly make DBC into my monastery. Also, I really luv typing on this keyboard, like seriously.\n\nI should write that blog post about how I luv my job because they pay me to luv my students and I would enjoy doing that anyway.\n\n11:13:05 PM: I got an email from Ilan today, the cofounder of Genius, saying he felt sorry that it didn't work out but that he enjoyed meeting me and reading why works. I told him that I hope we will stay in contact, as I find him a very smart guy. I think that he could help me launch Prosedy one day, which I still highly intend on doing. I suppose that DBC could also work well as a platform for helping me work on my own ideas to some extent. I can certainly use it as a test bed for a lot of my ideas.\n\nI think that I have typed rather quickly recently, so I think that could seem pretty cool.\n\nI can type in E-Prime pretty quickly now, I just have to train my brain to speak in it now. I think it could help if I read my own writing out loud. I think that I should go and read my own writing to myself as it contains a lot of good advice. And maybe I should write a lot more to myself. I think that I write to myself right now, but this doesn't have the intentional element of programming myself to the same extent that my other writing to myself does.","name":"2","updated":{"$date":"2014-08-08T03:53:29.446Z"}}

Or I should say, U really acted like a dunce in the past. We’ll use dunce as the pejorative form, because here we will consider playing the fool a positive thing. An enormously positive thing. In fact, U've acted like a dunce for not acting like a fool.\n\nU've read _Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind_ so U understand the concept of ‘beginner’s mind’ which we consider totally essential to zen practice. \n\nAssuming the role of the fool feels great for so many reasons. U will never feel patronized when someone explains something to U, because U need all the help U can get. U will work harder than other people, because U feel foolish. U will make up that disadvantage with pure grit. \n\nU will get along with people, because U feel continually humbled that they would even associate with a person as foolish as Urself.\n\nU will regain Ur sense of childish wonder at all the fascinating complexity in the world. U will never turn away from an opportunity to learn. U will know that every moment has an opportunity to grow. \n\nU used to think U had smarts. What a mistake. Whenever a subject felt difficult and it challenged the illusion of Ur intellect, U would shun it and declare it boring dross, not worthy of a mind so capable as Ur own. What a dunce U played! How many learnings U missed because U did not play a fool! Can U see that Ur ego made chemistry difficult? That U refused to learn, because U thought U had smarts?

Everything feels difficult when U play a fool, because a fool undertakes everything without conception of whether ze can do it or not. A dunce lives a life of ease, only doing what ze can without effort. And it turns out, U can't do much without effort. Can U harken back to when U browsed the internet, passively watched movies, lazed around all day aimlessly? And yet U felt so ‘smart’. How easy to analyze a film and a book, but how hard to create. How easy to criticize, and how hard to write. Do the things that feel hard. If it felt easy, it wouldn’t feel fun. Embrace Ur inner foolishness.\n\nIf U don’t play a fool, if U think U have an important ego full of interesting insights, then U might feel hurt when someone attacks Ur ideas as illogical, finds Ur ideas trite and commonplace, ridicules Ur ideas, steals Ur ideas, ignores Ur ideas. But if U act the fool U rejoice when someone points out a flaw in Ur logic. U laugh at their ridicule, for they seem very funny, and U luv to play the butt of a joke. U don’t value Ur ideas, so what matter if someone steals them? U feel used to people ignoring U. \n\nA fool’s life feels easy. U might find this paradoxical, but the harder way to live always feels easier. Practice playing a fool, I promise U won’t feel fooled. Or U will, and that contains the goal. Can I fool U into playing a fool? Can U fool Urself into playing a fool? Who says who looks like a fool anyway? Fool me and I’ll fool U, because it feels quite fun to fool around. Don’t fools seem to have fun? They act too foolish to realize the \"seriousness\" of the \"real\" world.","name":"2","updated":{"$date":"2014-08-08T18:40:08.068Z"}}

Started the day off by reading Secrets the Guru Won't Tell You, then I did the KAP meditation. Then I went out to the park, hung out for a bit in the tree, walked barefoot in the dewy grass (supposedly good for absorbing chi through the feet), did a lot of grounding exercises. Took my shirt off and basked in the sun and absorbed the sun's energy. Walked around slowly while visualizing my roots. Listened to the sax man that plays in the morning, really love that. Did the energy bone shaking exercise a bit, I think that one will get really awesome once I have practiced it a bunch. Did a bunch of sun salutations. I would like to practice some taijutsu and then get to writing up my new EE curriculum, which I will base around the four elements of the western magician. I think I will enjoy that quite a bit, and I hope that I can start to secretly teach it or not so secretly teach it. \n\nI think I need to come up with a mission statement for what I will do at DBC and that will make it feel worthwhile to me. I will make DBC my monastery, and I will lead all that I can to higher levels of enlightenment. \n\n11:04:54 AM: Waiting for Jon Stowe to connect to this Google Hangout. Maybe he has forgotten. I will wait for him for a little while but not forever. I might go get breakfast if he takes too long. For the mean time I will just wait for him while journaling.\n\n11:07:46 AM: Still no word from Jon. Maybe he has some checkins or something that has held him up? I understand that he has a lot going on, so I won't get impatient with him. If anything, I get an advantage if he feels bad for ignoring me constantly. Seriously, out of everyone I have had the least time with Jon or Bernado, because I always have something to do with the students, I don't have time to talk to the higher ups as I have my hands full with my students. \n\n11:08:50 AM: I want to fix everything about the phase 2 curriculum. Right now it has so many issues that I need to fix. \n\n12:15:17 PM: Had a really great conversation with Jon Stowe. Talking to him has really helped me feel better, and I think I gave him really helpful feedback on the space and on Lloyd. I think that I will get a raise from him if I do things smartly. He mentioned that compensation could get fixed, so that makes me feel hopeful. He said that a disproportionate number of students said that they favorited me as a teacher, which I feel pretty great about. He said they feel like I really form a solid connection with them and that they feel that I really connect with them as a coach and mentor and that I feel present. I sure try to!\n\n1:29:30 PM: Did a set of five tibetans, and a bunch of other exercises from this book. I think that I will have to convert a lot of the content in this book into wiki articles as they have a lot going on and I need to absorb it. A lot to take in, that book will take several readings. A lot of great info in there, even though the book functions as a sales mechanism for further products it already has so much in it that I feel like I could really go far just following. I feel really excited for the workshop, as I expect I will learn so much that I could teach at DBC. That nauli breathing looks insane, if I could do that people would definitely pay attention to what I have to teach. \n\n2:17:53 PM: Finished the book, although I sort of skimmed at the end.\n\n3:22:43 PM: Super long meeting ahoy!","name":"4","updated":{"$date":"2014-08-08T19:22:48.337Z"}}

Earlier in the day we started making love and I came almost immediately, before she finished, and then the semen burned her a bit so we stopped. Then in the afternoon she felt really nauseous and saw a lot of purple when she closed her eyes. She felt really drained suddenly.\n\n7:31:14 AM: Yesterday the deck I drafted felt pretty clunky. Too many two drops and five/six drops, not much to do in between. Not a big fan of that deck. And green and blue just didn't give me a lot of options in the long term. I felt like I always had to hold back because the only form of removal I had consisted of frogify which sucks.

Shu-nen. What I observed while working on tsuki recalls what Josh told me. I have to work on grounding my back leg, as from there derives all the thrusting force of the strike. I have not grounded my back foot during my practice, which robs me of power. Did a few unarmed tsuki working on the same concept.

In the dream I remember struggling to do one armed pushups. Trying very hard to find some place and way to get laid. Lots of hiding from police officers in various nooks and crannies and hallways. Crazy parties that we would start.

I tried to pull the coin out but it felt stuck in the slot, I applied some leverage and then suddenly a big piece of the concrete came loose. Underneath the concrete I found a canvas bag filled with bundles of cash, bottles of champaign, and bags of cocaine. I started collecting everything in the hole right away, focusing on getting the money and cocaine first. But inexplicably a police car drives up. I scramble to get everything inside the house, but apparently the police officer suspects something because he comes to the door and investigates.

Seems like a good place to work out of if I need it.\n\n12:16:44 PM: I really admire how Lloyd has owned up to his faults and has made a commitment to working through them and I like the way he has communicated recently. Of course I also enjoy the fact that I got a 10k raise without asking for it. Seems like the sigil worked because I really do have enough for everything I need. Excited for the other sigils to work and for my big sigil art project which I think I will really enjoy. I might want to get into chinese calligraphy or calligraphy in general with a calligraphy pen, I think I would enjoy that a lot.\n\n12:17:59 PM: Hm, seems like I haven't typed in a while, need a bit of practice to get back into this.\n\n12:37:20 PM: Pretty interesting to review my old emails from OHS. I guess I had a lot of homework and I handled a lot. Didn't feel like I really handled it at the time, but really I had a lot to do and I mostly survived. Interesting to see the messages I had with Maya. So obvious in retrospect that she loved me, but I never said anything to her. I guess part of love involves letting go and I feel glad that she found Daniel because he seems to make genuinely happy. I miss her of course, but I don't regret the way things turned out. I learned a lot of valuable life lessons from letting Maya get away. I will say, I thought Maya had all the perfect qualities I wanted, but really Maya doesn't represent Her. \n\n1:29:11 PM: Cool, todo list starting to look pretty manageable. \n\n2:29:42 PM: Huh, interesting. Never thought that would make a difference. Very interesting to learn how that local time thing in JavaScript works. Okay, so now I stand here typing, kind of out of immediate stuff to do, just waiting for Andrew to show up. Expecting him already, not quite sure. Did he mean that he had a train towards Penn Station at 1:45? I thought he might arrive there by 1:45, but I can wait for him. I've got plenty to read, for sure.\n\n7:01:47 PM: Had a great time visiting with Andrew. We got Dos Toros and caught up. Walked around in WSQ park. Talking to Josh currently. I need to work on the Lovism EE. :) \n\n7:39:06 PM: Cool, wrote up my experiences with the sexism EE reboot that I called the L word EE. I think it will make a splash, or at least I hope so. \n\n7:39:31 PM: Time to play with my sword again. Shu-nen I have named it. Perhaps I will just call it tenacity. IDK. 執念\n\n8:10:54 PM: Did a lot of koho seigan nuki. Noticed that on the right handed draw I tended to stomp while going back so I focused on shifting back. Also focused on keeping my back shoulder down and elbow in when doing koho.\n\n8:17:23 PM: Did a bunch of tsuki trying to focus on keeping the back leg planted the whole time so that I can actually deliver some force with the strike and not fall over. Good goals to have while striking I think...\n\n9:13:58 PM: I think I will cast the spell to destroy my enemies on LaTeesha Thomas because I felt a little bit of resentment against her and I don't want that.\n\n_I forgive LaTeesha Thomas. LaTeesha Thomas did not come into existence to do me harm. I love LaTeesha Thomas. LaTeesha Thomas came here to learn, as did we all. I forgive LaTeesha Thomas. LaTeesha Thomas learned from her mistakes. I love LaTeesha Thomas. LaTeesha Thomas is one of us. I forgive LaTeesha Thomas._\n\n9:15:49 PM: Okay, feel better now, back to reading Sam Harris.\n\n9:53:40 PM: Wow, feel pretty lonely right now. And I guess I feel like I should have started the KAP meditation a while ago but I seriously thought that Daria would come home by now. I luv her. I miss her. But I will prevail. I have done a lot of physical practice today and I will continue to work on myself with the tenacity of a sword smith working a mighty piece of steel.\n\n10:11:22 PM: Well, had a great time reading Sam Harris. Glad he has brought awareness of the benefits of mindfulness. I will now continue to pursue the kundalini.\n\n12:37:41 AM: Didn't do KAP as Daria got home but I did take the time to give her a message while we had our talk and an orgasm. I felt really awesome today and we kept at it for quite a while after she had her first.","name":"12","updated":{"$date":"2014-08-22T04:38:16.744Z"}}

Some of the tiles had nasty traps that would come out of them. The dungeons had various assortments of monsters and harmless creatures. I remember feeding a rabbit, but before that I had to do battle with demons. Fortunately I remembered how to stair dance and I avoided hard battles that way and would instead circle around from another staircase and pick off enemies one by one. Overall I had pretty good survival instincts in such a hostile environment. Seemingly the last staircase I went down I ended up in that battle. The battle may have been a simulation in the dream, because before all the strange videogame stuff I remember being with my family and Andy at the library, and some events led up to that too I only have a murky recall of.\n\n12:24:32 AM: Having trouble sleeping to do a few things on my mind.

I will move along with this.\n\n9:26:18 PM: Practiced koho seigan nuki and tsuki with Tenacity. Did some shizen to hicho no kamae. Did a lot of pullups today will continue to do more.

We could go at either 5 or 6, he only had two seats so it would take a while to get everyone over there. Before that I dreamed that I drove a car all around and the police chased me and I had to stop and get out and surrender at one point but the police maybe tried to shoot me anyway even though they had already cuffed me to the ground. I remember biking with Mark and Andy through some shortcuts and secret bike paths that Mark showed us. We biked in the dark at night.\n\n3:22:30 PM: Had a tough conversation with Daria last night. I think it had some productive effect. I admitted to her that I admired Monica and wished that I had some of that same dynamic in our own relationship, and I let her know that I've felt some disappointment with her during our relationship. I believe she can grow.\n\n9:03:56 PM: Had a really easy time at work today, this cohort really makes life easy. I have to make sure I feel prepared to both give lecture tomorrow and my meditation EE. I hope to see Max tomorrow when he comes in to mentor, I think that'll feel cool.\n\n9:06:28 PM: Had a good class today in the park. Cameron, Kosky, Will, Anthony, and Josh all showed up. I've never seen that many people show up for a Tuesday class. We practiced tsuki and uke, sui no kata, gyoku-ryu ichimonji no kata, and ura gyaku. Kosky showed me some very interesting improvements with ura gyaku. I just have to stay relaxed and keep my body straight and keep pushing them off and then it becomes quite easy. I always underestimate how much Kosky can teach me because he seems quite rusty himself but he has a lot of valuable knowledge and wisdom for someone who can implement it like I can. Josh complimented me today on a circle I made during uke, which James gave me a bit of shit for. He called me a prodigy. Eh, I will just have to grin and bear through that stuff. I do hope that one day I exceed everyone in the dojo, but only so that I can teach them.\n\n9:09:40 PM: Did a bunch of pullups and I want to practice with Tenacity still today. I made a commit today just to make sure to keep my streak going, but I think I should make a bunch more to ensure that I have something to show the owls tomorrow.","name":"2","updated":{"$date":"2014-08-27T01:10:11.989Z"}}

Rebecca shared a story of how a friend got to NYC late for an appointment and then went to eat at some restaurant. Ended up gaining 100 lbs after living here a year.\n\n8:24:58 PM: Okay, so interesting day I suppose. Felt a bit tired due to the lack of sleep last night, but it feels worthy as I gave Daria quite an intense orgasm last night. Felt bad that I came first and I had to get it on for her again, so much easier when she comes first but I suppose it happens sometimes.\n\n8:26:00 PM: Daria said she will stay at Hacker School for quite a while since she only has another day left. I have decided that I will use this matt matt time very productively to do what I need to do. \n\n8:30:22 PM: I taught Jen some techniques with balancing her spine and posture, so I enjoyed that. I think I will teach her breathing soon. I guess only she showed up for the mini-EE today, but I don't mind. I like Jen, I think she will go places. I like the owls a lot, I have a lot of fun working with them. I don't have a lot to do most days now it feels like. I read a lot about astrology today. My head felt positively abuzz today while reading, I think it has a lot of interesting aspects. \n\n8:39:07 PM: Don't have time to waste with Josh tonight. I guess I will have more to do tomorrow because I will patrol in order to help out the Woolly Bear Caterpillars, since they feel like they don't have enough help from teachers. \n\n8:40:27 PM: Yeah, so I went to taijutsu and then just left because Donovan didn't want to hold class with just the two of us and him still dressed for work, and I decided to skip the game night because I mostly just wanted to see Monica there and she couldn't go, so I have stayed at home to get some work done.\n\n8:42:59 PM: I think I will practice with Tenacity for a while before I continue on to doing more astrology research. I really enjoy what I've read so far. My biggest point of resistance: I have 6 fixed signs but I don't consider myself a very stubborn/fixed/determined person, very interesting. But I did just recently start to integrate water into my personality, so maybe... I seem well balanced on the yin/yang line though. Just slightly more yang than yin.\n\n9:06:05 PM: Practiced koho seigan nuki, tsuki, hicho-no-kamae. Did pullups, one set of pistols, pushups. \n\n9:08:59 PM: Worked up quite a nice sweat today. And didn't take too long either. Maybe I will do a round of KAP meditation now. That could feel great. \n\n9:14:21 PM: Okay, loaded the laundry in the dryer. I think I will do KAP now. That would feel nice, and then I can get back to reading about astrology.\n\n9:22:08 PM: Okay, made my soylent for the day. Annoyingly the pitcher has a bit of a leak but hopefully Daria will bring back the other one from Hacker School and that one should work a lot better. I will now do KAP, having taken care of my business for the day.\n\n10:04:32 PM: Awesome KAP session today. It definitely works better when sitting straight rather than lying down. I suppose now I believe Dr. Morris when he said that for doing kundalini one must meditate sitting down. Very enjoyable. Very powerful chills when I thought about orgasm today.\n\n10:10:06 PM: Did a bunch of code reviews today, which I feel good about. I think I will chill out for a bit and read more about astrology now.\n\n10:48:42 PM: Cool, did the laundry. On a roll tonight.

I arranged to drive over to Andy's house with my whole family. I got signed up for some kind of soccer program and had to write a check for it.\n\n8:16:21 PM: Starting to feel pretty smart for having already begun the alchemical work of integrating planets that I have had problems with even before starting to study astrology. Feeling very interested and drawn towards astrology now. The system has so much more depth than I ever imagined, since I have only seen the caricatures of it that get published in national newspapers, and the descriptions that my father has told me. Feeling good about having started to harness Mars and Saturn as I feel they have very important aspects to bring into my life. Excited to start to analyze myself more and more.\n\n8:17:42 PM: Today work felt good, but I felt like I didn't get to spend enough time with the students between the lunch at Haru to send off Tanner (although I greatly enjoyed the sushi, especially the free meal aspect of the sushi since I didn't get to bring soylent in again). Maybe I will just keep some of my soylent materials at DBC and make it for myself there. Yeah, I could keep half my stash here and half at DBC.\n\n8:20:28 PM: Practiced koho seigan nuki and tsuki with Tenacity. Also doing some tsuki open handed, and will do some hicho no kamae and uke.\n\n8:22:13 PM: So weird, my right leg has so much more trouble with hicho than my left. \n\n8:44:45 PM: Conserved my energy today despite seeing some AC. Good work... Now to harness that into some KAP meditation.\n\n9:24:47 PM: Well, didn't get to KAP meditation yet because I went back for more. Still conserved my energy though.

Some bands decided to change the music despite explicit instructions from the writer and performer of the original music (who professed a roman catholic faith) that it shouldn't get changed, but several bands did so anyway. I wanted to hang out with Andy. Dad and I talked about whether people did their homework while drunk. I had anxiety about dad driving, as usual. He knocked over a bicycle in a garage while driving and we had a hard time picking up Mark. In an earlier part of a dream I remember playing magic cards with Mark and Andy. \n\n5:39:39 PM: Well. It has happened. Kitkat and Daria now reside at Columbia. In some sense they have left my life, in another sense I still feel a deep connection to them. I feel sad, and yet happy for them.

Strong energy shivers today, some more success with seeing colors. Basically did five point breathing from the beginning when the orbits began rather than waiting for his cue to begin. So far, good day. Had a nice conversation with Daria and with my family tonight, so I enjoyed catching up with people. Hoping to have sexual intercourse with Daria tomorrow, so I have decided to avoid other activities in prepartion for that. Huh, my wiki just started to act very strange. Not really sure what just happened there. It switched me randomly to the astrology page and claimed that I didn't log in. It seems to do some strange behavior from time to time. I think I will do a lot more writing in the coming days when I have the privacy screen setup in my journal. I could start writing some fiction and some rituals to perform.

Dreamed about putting some money in Priscilla's bank account. Dreamed about visiting a couple's apartment and watching an anime series and playing some sort of game with the boyfriend, who treated his girlfriend very badly but I didn't want to cause a scene a standup against him in his own house especially since she just seemed very embarrassed and didn't want any trouble. Then I thought about having to piss and as a result I awoke at 7 just as I planned. So now I have to iron out what I want to get done when I get up at 7. I think I want to do KAP. \n\n7:45:25 AM: Good KAP meditation today. Not superbly strong, but still happy to have done it first thing in the morning. I feel nice and awake right now and I feel good. Great way to start the day.\n\n7:59:46 AM: Practiced koho seigan nuki and tsuki. Also a little annoyed at the occasional unreliability of this wiki. Silly meteor. Not sure what to do about it. Maybe use Angular?\n\n8:03:47 AM: Pullups and a set of pistols.\n\n10:47:39 AM: Lecture priorities: using jQuery to do AJAX with Sinatra. Using OOJS to do JavaScript racer.\n\n11:18:19 AM: Okay, feel like I have a lot of lecture materials to prepare, but I think I have ample time. I just overestimate how long things will take.\n\n4:04:10 PM: Day going pretty well I would have to say. I think I gave satisfactory lectures that covered a lot of important points and most importantly I prepared a lot of code in preparation so that they could refer to something and I showed them a lot of live coding. Making soylent at DBC seems like a pretty awesome strategy so far. I think I will bring in more packets so that I don't run out here. I wish that fridge cooled a little faster as the soylent I have here feels a bit warm still. Also, I don't get why the soylent clumps so much more now.\n\n9:33:29 PM: Ah, Aliza. What to do. I feel very horny right now, I keep having close brushes with temptation. Daria came quite hard from the sound and look of it and the feel of it really, we got high before hand, that always helps. I didn't come, and her handjob felt rather rough so I didn't come from that either. Now I don't know quite what to do. Maybe some sex magick.\n\n9:42:58 PM: Well, I already checked off conserve energy so I will conserve my energy tonight. I will simply do some practice until the feeling passes and then study the ninja book until I fall asleep. Gotta get up bright and early again tomorrow.\n\n9:46:07 PM: Okay, some working out always does wonders for clearing the head. I feel as though maybe I could do the KAP meditation again tonight, but I feel like I would have a better time if I just did it in the morning again. \n\n10:13:21 PM: Did a bunch of tsuki and koho seigan nuki. Feel much better now, very refreshing. Meteor just did a weird thing where I lost a bunch of my writing again. Started to feel a bit wary of this. Maybe a warning not to reveal certain techniques in writing, very well then.\n\n10:41:41 PM: 7/22, not great results with the ESP trainer, but something.

If we will only listen and be ready to learn from our experiences, we will find the wisdom to gain enlightenment.\n\n2. Kami, sincerity, compassion, naturally devoting oneself to obeying nature – by continually searching for all of these a great light (daikômyô) can appear.\n\n3. The teaching of the gods shall eternally protect those who are right in heart and body. The sound of words in our reach for enlightenment, creates the divine cosmic light.\n\n4. Conceptually translated as, “Every experience contains the potential for the enlightenment we seek”.\n\n5. The phrase has roots in both Japanese and Sanskrit. The SHI of the phrase translates literally as “words”. The KIN translates as “sounds”. The combination has the meaning of “an encounter” or “something that occurs to/at me”. HARAMITSU is the Japanese sound of paramita, a Sanskrit term that roughly translates as “perfection of wisdom.” DAI KO MYO translates as “great bright light” by means of which illumination “dawns on us.”\n\n6. It’s a reminder for us to be ever mindful, to be ever aware that each one of these moments that make up our life could be that special moment. It’s like putting together one of these jigsaw puzzles.

Some coworker from Sailthru showed up and we began flirting and I told her that I never saw her drunk while at Sailthru. Unclear to me who.

I remember some kind of school situation where the students had to fend off zombies together.\n\n5:35:29 PM: Interesting day so far. Woke up at 8 so I didn't get to do a lot of my morning routine, but still felt good this morning as I got to do yoga with Whitney. Always enjoyable.

James and Mike always mess around a lot but they pretty much taught me a lot of everything and still have so many good points. I have to remember that James has a black belt and I only have a green belt. Mike showed me how I need to keep my head on the line and I keep messing that up.

I have sweat all over my body and I still feel shivers running through me. I felt like at one point I figured out how to breathe and cause shivers and that constituted pulling energy. I feel as though we can pull in energy using our hair as attractors or straws to suction in energy. No wonder hair has a connection with energy then, and that some animals can generate so much energy. I will have to investigate this more. A lot of sensation in this session, I like this setup of sitting on the wooden chair in front of the laptop I find it very conducive.

I think this signals a fundamental change in my attitude and perspective. I actually feel excited about all I want to do and have gotten up in the morning to do this. Feels good to know that with Daria away I feel like I can get up as early as I want to. I will read some email and catch up on some internet quickly (although I have already done enough catching up on internet) and then I think I will do the KAP meditation.\n\n7:03:27 AM: Started KAP meditation but stopped suddenly. For some reason I don't feel like going through with it right this moment, maybe I anticipate how intense it can get. Maybe I should start to do it on my own without instruction because that would allow me to go through a full cycle in a much shorter time. I stopped at my solar chakra.\n\n7:42:14 AM: Anyway, still feeling good about the morning. I did just a few sets of koho seigan nuki and tsuki with the understanding that I will do a lot more taijutsu this evening at class. I have to remember to bring Josh back the scroll case today. I think I will pack up soon. I feel a bit yawney, but I feel like when I get some sunlight I will perk up. \n\n10:09:40 AM: Nice yoga class today with Whitney. And I cleared up some stuff with her, so in the future when we work on basics like bridge I can just go ahead and do full wheel, she says I should just bring my practice. I feel good. Looking forward to tactical with the teachers today. Feel good about connecting with Raphael, and with some of the whoolly bears this morning. Raphael wants to find remote work because he needs to return to Brazil when he finishes DBC. \n\n10:11:17 AM: I feel pretty cool about how Dave Hoover gest to have a meeting at the whitehouse, pretty exciting in my opinion.

Of the challenges she did do it seems like Drew basically did them for her. Like he actually drove. I don't know what the hell to think of that. Anyway, I contacted Lexi to get the problems fixed and followed up with Hilary. So I think I did the right things.\n\n10:06:13 PM: Class today... haha, I feel like Josh had intended to lay a trap for the new students or something because he changed the location suddenly and apparently didn't expect both of the new students to show up? But I went to the wrong place, went to WSQ and then remember that the class got moved to Mercer so I brought them over with me. Showed up pretty late, but whatevs. I worked a bunch with Keno and Kosky today, I think I learned a bunch. I finally learned how jumonji really works, I think. I have to match and get underneath, and then do uke pushing up from underneath which throws them up. \n\n10:44:28 PM: Getting tired of standing. Getting tired in general. Feel good about all the code review I did though. I think I need to check in with Jessica and Nick because they both seem behind. Probably Daniel too, but Daniel has sought help which bodes well for him. Excited about the new assessment format though. Maybe I will KAP meditate now.

Often turns dark brown. Gets rather sludge like. I imagine microbes find it pretty nutritious. I definitely encourage caution when it comes to washing containers. One difficult to clean steel bottle has become a strange little ecosystem of microbes that can survive my freezer. I still have it in there as I would one day like to study it. Perhaps we can form beneficial relations with Soylent digesting microbes. I would not feel surprised to learn that they have taken up residence in my gut and helped my adaptation to the food. The initial gastro-intestinal gas has dramatically decreased since I began.\n\nOnce I went for a while (around a week) without washing the pitcher that I used to make Soylent. When I finally went to wash it I found that when cleaning the sides of the pitcher the water became very cloudy. Upon trying to drink that water I found it very mineral and water heavy and I did not react well to it. Seems like a certain amount of the mineral content gets lost (residue at the bottom of cups, on the sides of containers) but it may actually come as a blessing. Perhaps I don't need quite so much potassium.\n\nI've definitely learned to drink a lot more water after drinking Soylent. The water in Soylent itself does not suffice.\n\nI received my second shipment of 4 boxes of Soylent, and I've tried 4 packs from one of the new boxes. The formula has changed since I received my first boxes, as announced on the Soylent blog. I think they changed how fine some of the ingredients like the oat grits get ground. As a result I've had to change my recipe for making Soylent, as the powder now clumps.\n\nOld recipe:\n- Smoosh bag to break up clumps\n- Pour powder in pitcher\n- Add 1/3 of the pitcher of water\n- Shake vigorously\n- Add rest of water (fill to 4/5 of the pitcher)\n- Add oil blend\n- Shake vigorously\n\nThat recipe worked great. With the new batch of Soylent however this resulted in clumps of dry Soylent forming at the bottom of the pitcher, buffered by a hydrophilic wall of semi-dry Soylent. Very strange. My new recipe which avoids clumping follows.\n\nNew recipe:\n- Smoosh bag to break up clumps\n- Add 1/5 of the pitcher water\n- Pour powder in pitcher\n- Fill to 1/3 of the pitcher\n- Shake vigorously\n- Add rest of water (fill to 4/5 of the pitcher)\n- Add oil blend\n- Shake vigorously\n\nHaving a layer of water above and below the powder avoids clumping during the shaking process.\n\nI've found that Soylent can taste drastically different depending on what I eat before hand. If I eat lots of salty foods I don't taste the delicious saltiness of Soylent and other notes get highlighted. If I've had more than enough carbs then I don't taste the sweetness but taste the saltiness. I find Soylent usually tastes good, because it always has some nutrient or another that I didn't get enough of in a casual diet.\n\nI find it very interesting to hear people's differing reports of how Soylent tastes. I think it reveals some aspects of their diet.\n\nI now have two pitchers, so I have left a pitcher at [DBC](DBC) and some packets there. I used to carry Soylent from my home to work, now I make it directly at work. I haven't made it completely convenient or established a habit of making it at work yet, so I will have to see how that turns out.\n\nOverall I feel really grateful for Soylent, although I would like to supplement my diet with fresh fruit and possibly substitute Clif Bars to eat at work, as the form factor of Clif Bars feels more convenient to me.\n\nI would still recommend Soylent to people who feel like they want to get food cheaply and don't want to cook and have an overall focus on saving our most precious resource: time.\n\nI will say I do not find it perfect. I feel highly skeptical that the US Food \u0026 Drug Administration managed to perfectly calculate the dietary needs of my body. I like to supplement my Soylent with any \"real\" food that my body feels a craving for. I believe first and foremost in listening carefully to the body's natural instincts for what to eat. Perhaps one day Soylent will release software that allows us to calibrate a Soylent blend for our individual bodies that optimizes our performance.

I think she has a husband given that she has a ring with a diamond on it, but maybe she could bring friends. I find her physique quite attractive. Josh helped me understand that for tsuki I need to keep the back hand down so that I thrust the sword up not just forward. Very crucial to practice.

I have some time to work before I go to the picnic and then come back for GNK. I just have to withdraw a little bit more cash in order to pay my dues, so that should workout fine, I think I finally planned for it in advance well enough.

Did tsuki and tried holding it again, definitely a nice workout to hold kamae like Dr. Morris alluded to. \n\n1:22:49 PM: Did a lot of programming today, which I quite enjoyed.

Another dream where a bunch of us stayed in a house together, and I went around throwing away all the knives because I felt afraid of one of the people we stayed with.\n\n1:42:52 PM: I've got some crazy wrist pain right now for some reason. Had saigon shack with Daria before she left for Columbia this morning. Glad to have Daria back for the weekend, I had a nice time with her. I really enjoyed watching The Sound of Music with her. I do wish I could figure out why my wrists hurt, probably because of how I've tried to hold my phone while working on my eyesight. Rather unfortunate, that.

I gave up on Morgante's project because I didn't want to deal with all the setup, and I had other projects I wanted to work on. I pushed a lot of commits today on Ninjstar so that I would have a demo for my students. I will let them vote tomorrow whether they would like me to start live coding from the beginning, or from the middle, in either case I think they will learn a lot about what they need to do in JavaScript racer.\n\n7:09:21 PM: I did a bunch of practice with Tenacity, including koho seigan nuki and some tsuki which I held. I think the idea of holding kamae has a lot of merit. I like recording the practice I do in self-mastree, I find it very pleasant. I think I might work on it a bit tonight. I haven't worked on this wiki much recently, because I feel pretty happy with it I must say.\n\n7:10:31 PM: Had a lot of really close calls with temptation today. Several times where I almost came but I held it back. I have gotten pretty good at withholding (good hangman word, double hh? weird) orgasms, I must say. Alexis Crystal has nothing on me, as it turns out. A lot of shitty porn out there and I do regret the time I wasted browsing. But at least I conserved my energy. I probably ought to do the KAP meditation at some point, especially after I read some more of Path Notes. I ought to write down more of path notes and systemize it into practices for myself. I still don't know if I want to order dinner or just have Soylent. Perhaps I should start on the Soylent now and see how I feel. Anyway, I have this idea that women can achieve enlightenment by having seven consecutive orgasms. One for each chakra, the orgasms bring up the energy. Good for Daria that she has now had two in a row. I will have to see if I can make that a regular occurrence and then see if I can break her through to three.\n\n11:38:01 PM: Okay, time for bed I think.

We talked about her piano practice a bit today. She has a recital coming up for her graduate school and she also does some competitions so she has setup a theme for her recital that I found pretty cool. One song involved a story about an incarnation of Vishnu saving the world from getting pulled into an ocean. She has learned a bunch of Debussy's Preludes and some Schumann too. She also started learning some of Clara Schumann's music, who I didn't know wrote any music. Interesting. James showed up too.

So I will work on Self-Mastree and try making it an app so I can use it on my phone. That will require a lot of work but I think I will find it useful. At the very least I will move my daily practices off of todoist and onto eslf-mastree where they belong. \n\n11:08:29 PM: Alright, well, I suppose I shall go to bed now and I will experiment with staying in my other bed in the other room so that I don't have to setup and teardown the mats here.

Dreamed that twice I ordered pizzas but they didn't deliver. Dreamed of playing league of legends with Andy. I dreamed that I bait the enemy team under my towers at level one and we ended up killing a lot of them and using our momentum we very quickly pushed down all their towers on one side of the map and won. Dreamed of a bunch of college students and their RA making lewd jokes in my hallway. \n\n7:56:36 AM: Well, surprisingly it seems like I have finished most of my work. I think I will do some kenjutsu before I head off to work. I will demonstrate some more ajax and jquery by adding ajax delete buttons to the luv stream application.\n\n10:07:23 PM: A most momentous occasion. A very productive meeting with Jacob that I think will open up entirely new universes of knowledge and innovation. The amount of synnergy generated by this evening alone I found well worth a lifetime of waiting. He confirmed for me the physical existence of chi as well as many other interesting factors. I think he has several of the secret ingredients required to make a truly great wiki software and I feel thrilled to host him in my home. A very great moment indeed. \n\n10:12:40 PM: I felt slightly bad for leaving Taijutsu early but I felt a tug that I ought to and I felt that I couldn't perform the technique we would have practiced anyway and so I happened to have some time to prepare for Jacob coming and I feel so happy that I found him.

I ended up urinating into a toilet in my dream and missing the toilet and pissing on myself which resulted in real life urination. So not a great way to start the day, but I don't feel too upset. In the manor Kevin and I smoked a fat joint that he rolled and we talked about how we hadn't seen Death Cab for Cutie in concert but we had seen Postal Service. We lay on a bed together passing the joint around between the three of us. I told Kevin how the last three parties could have turned out late if he hadn't intervened by providing awesome marijuana for everyone, what a great guy. Evan remarked that he felt cold and that it felt like early spring, yet he wore only shorts and a t-shirt. I remember a dream fragment where I drove somewhere in America with my family and we visited a library that proud said population 1.6k on it and I found it very peculiar. I went to a hackathon like hackRU and I spent a lot of it talking about how crappy on-duty at Sailthru felt. I saw Kristie there. I think I saw Jacob too, he demoed this huge electronic and mechanical contraption he built that looked like a series of switches on boxes. I also dreamed that I went to some huge convention for like games and legos and such and I walked out with a bunch of rare minifigures. I remember a shopkeeper refusing to sell me anything even though he sold Jacob stuff. I remember finding some awesome ninja minifigure. I actually dreamed that I woke up and typed up my dreams like now, but as an intermission between two of my dreams, very interesting. I suppose I have done this enough now that it has gotten integrated in my dream psyche too.\n\n7:20:10 PM: What a fascinating experience doing tai chi with Jacob. I very strongly felt the energy today throughout my body and I could very easily feel how I could shape the energy with my hands and body motion. A very transmoative experience overall. I have decided today that I must pusue a study of tai chi with some seriousness as it seems like more so than yoga it fits my constitution, perhaps because of my chinese ancestry. I feel excited to combine the traditions of the east and the west in my quest for the great work. \n\n7:21:49 PM: I had a really great experience in EE today where I connected with Alex, Francisco, and Nicolle I gave them the feedback that I want more connection with them and that I hope. \n\n7:22:54 PM: I think what Josh said yesterday contained much profoundness. First we must stop the person in uke, and having established that moment of connection we can then flow. So he has started to feveal the secrets of water, but of course those secrets have grounding in the earth. So still I have much work todo on the plane of the earth, but I hope that soon I will flow into water.

A lot of people had trouble with the wifi although it worked for me. Vividly recall Sarah within my dreams. Rebecca asked me for help as she also came along on the train ride. I also remember trying to convince Andy to come to a hackathon that Kevin Z and I went to. I remember having to sort through utensils from a house we lived together in like hightower. \n\n1:18:06 PM: What a great day. Got a bunch of great fresh food from the farmer's market, including a great deal on honey. And then I met Billy and some other friends from the Temple of Thelema. I think I will try to attend their event on October 5th and meet some more of the temple members and see what vibe I get from them. I liked Billy, despite his subtle digs against the OTO (although to speak honestly, I felt like the OTO looked middle age and flabby, like they didn't really exercise their True Will). Billy and Enrico looked like they had their shit together and I liked the aesthetic I saw at the ToT. What a beautiful day out today. \n\n6:45:42 PM: Good class with James Light, Josh, and Nicole today. We went over a bunch of techniques related to that receive we do with the sword where the arms come up straight and up. Apparently that has a deep relationship to mae uke that I don't understand. I will go with Jacob to a dinner with his friends and then I will head over to Dan's housewarming. And I will have a lot of adventures. Good times.\n\n6:55:38 PM: Haha, Jacob has a lot of phone calls of the time. Also I felt a bit surprised that he hadn't left yet. And I guess he gives everyone the same spiel. He will definitely do well as an entrepreneur. Anyway, I think I will read about the OTO for a little while right now since I've got some time to kill while I wait for him to have this phone call. \n\n11:26:49 PM: Billy gave me an interesting Tarot reading today. I asked how I would find friends who would aid my spiritual progress. By friends I really meant a lover. Ace of Swords, Princess of Swords, and Two of Wands. Under two of wands I had the 5 and 6 of cups. Apparently the 5 of Cups represents \"break-ups\" a lot of the time... according to Billy. Interesting subtext there.\n\n11:38:37 PM: Well, I suppose I just wait here. And do my thing.\n\n12:01:34 AM: Feeling like I need a purpose and I need a solid project. I think I should work on making Self-Mastree totally awesome. I don't care to work on DBC stuff this weekend, as I feel it leaves me a bit burned out during the week, if I got any indication this week.\n\n12:24:13 AM: Observation.

I can think of few things more rational than getting a free lunch. \n\nOf course, we have to pick our irrational beliefs _very_ carefully in order to actually derive a free lunch.

I entered a hotel room and two women still lay on the beds in ecstasy from orgasms that Neal gave them. Neal scammed some large corporation out of millions of dollars. Some kind of video game, and someone from the video game company explained the game in terms of MoBA mechanics. Mark played the game pretty well and dad watched him play and critiqued his play like he cared about Mark's career as a gamer.\n\n8:07:27 PM: Well, a very interesting day. Daria came over and I made her lunch and breakfast. And I gave her a great orgasm to make up for the other night when she didn't get one due to my durdling.

About the sim city games, about building legos. He drove me home, basically. On the way we stopped for some soda. He gave me an orange fanta and he picked up a pack of dr. pepper along with a lighter from a little mom and pop bodega on the way. We dropped Derek off at this fancy looking mansion with a lot of black people in it. I dreamed about a serial killer who kept coming back to life, and UFOs. The serial killer turned off the lights in my family's house and setup a bunch of trip wires all over the place. He removed his victim's head. He used to act in movies and had quite a successful career, until people figured out that he would play the part of his victims before killing them. He had an insane delusion that by collecting enough body parts he could become permanently immortal... but he did keep coming back from the dead. Except that I finally removed his head from his body, preventing him from coming alive again. He tried to kill Priscilla and I killed him for it. \n\n10:54:52 AM: Wow, so that tarot reading that Billy gave...  Ace of Swords represents the idea graph idea, right now a pure seed of thought. Jacob, the King of Swords, fiery thought. He provides the passion in intellectual projects. 10 of Disks, Wealth, obviously represents Nicolas Berggruen. The Princess of Swords represents Ruthie Nachmay (apparently a close friend of Eric Weiser! she studied anthropology and film production at Princeton and then attended flatiron school, she works at Fundera, a market for small business loans), the \"competition\" and \"money\" represent the donation I made to her marathon. Lastly 2 of Wands, dominion refers to my dominion. 5 and 6 of cups, disappointment and pleasure (subtext from yijing, work on the spoiled) represent my making amends to Daria for her missed orgasm. Boom. Wow. So he gave me a general reading, since the original question I asked, \"How can I meet friends who will support my spiritual progress\" he answered already by telling me to join the Temple of Thelema. Pretty convincing. Given the tarot power Billy demonstrated I will certainly investigate the order.\n\n9:42:41 PM: Well, interesting enough day today. People seemed to get the Twitter stuff pretty well, all things considered, so I feel pretty happy about that. I think the security lecture went pretty well and I kept it under a good amount of time. Got a lot of coding done while at work, which I appreciated. Felt a bit bad because Katherine has really started to rub me raw with sitting next to me constantly. It has caused me to start withdrawing from outside sensory input while at work because I find her distracting. I would like to talk to her about her effect on people around her trying to work. Anyway, good class with Josh today. He got pretty snappy with David Kosky today, but David really has some shit form. He has evidently lost quite a lot of ground. Mike and I got in a good amount of training though. \n\n9:45:10 PM: I received a LONG email from Ethan which I have replied to saying that I will need a little while in order to write a longer reply. I don't know that I consider Jacob's project necessarily the right one for me, but I will basically ask him for my ideal job and see if he wants to give it to me. If I could have a lot more time to practice taijutsu and go to class, cut out my commute and get to work on interesting problems, then I think I could enjoy it. So I will just play hard to get in the mean time and see what he offers.\n\n9:46:39 PM: I feel kind of annoyed with Daria.

Dreamed that I almost got into physical altercations with dad and I had already planned that I would attack his weak points at his hands but mom intervened.

Important to drop weight while bringing the knee up to the chest. Try going from shizen to ichimonji nanamae while simultaneously bringing the front leg up to kick. Must relax into drop. Went over ku no kata. Went over turning to side to receive strike. \n\n11:12:27 PM: Strong sensations of energy all throughout my head tonight. Wondering if Josh has started transmitting some energy to me, since he has started to give me a lot more in terms of the techniques he does on me. I have to start doing massage with him. Too good to pass up. Also private classes. Since he studies shiatsu he most know how to manipulate energy. I think he just threw me off a little by the way he responded to my question about Path Notes, but I think he responded correctly by getting me to actually focus on learning the taijutsu which constitutes the element of earth in the bujinkan system.\n\n11:17:55 PM: I think I ought so sleep soon, but first I will establish a good score for me to try and beat tomorrow.\n\n11:29:14 PM: Meditated for 4 minutes. Some thoughts that came to head: fluoride in water, pineal gland calcification. Maybe look into buying a water filter? I think I could benefit. Other thought: mental concern or tension surrounding Daria. I feel that I should show her compassion but her going to columbia brings up a lot of inferiority complexes I have about school and also it brings up a lot of resentment and disappointment that I have about how she spent the last year with me.

So I went to class and Justin, Nicole, and both James showed up along with Josh. We reviewed Ku no Kata, and the sword uke technique we have practiced. We also did bo-uke-gata which has similarities to the sword technique but with the bo. We also practiced deflecting kicks from shizen by dropping into kamae, but not into profile. Interestingly today in class we didn't go into profile for every technique, in fact several techniques relied on not going into profile.\n\n9:42:47 PM: I got a lot of coding done on Self-Mastree, and I corrected the mistake of not including createdAt times, so now I can actually compute some overall averages.

I wanted to give U a full rundown of just how helpful this has proven and thank U for your wonderful gift. Overall this has had a hugely positive influence on my daily life. I really appreciate the time and effort U clearly put into this analysis and I hope I can do it justice through my daily practice. Thank U again for showing me your ability. \n\nI feel interested in the 6 month transit too, in case U feel willing to do that at this point in time. \n\nI actually don't have many questions from this, but I think I would from that. In what U've already written to me everything just struck such a deep chord that I only have one question: can U teach me astrology or point me in the right direction towards learning it?\n\n\"Your fire planets give you a hot, dry nature, and your earth planets give you a cold, dry nature: therefore there is an abundance of dryness. This can be balanced by drinking lots of filtered water, and eating moist fruits and vegetables with every meal; otherwise, rigidity of body and mind may result; the formation of stones; or hardening of the joints and arteries. Stretch every day, and make sure not to sit for long periods. Avoid processed foods, and eat virgin oils such as olive and coconut. If you can spend time near or on bodies of water, this will also help soothe your dry temperament.\"\n\nI work by the Hudson River so I have started going to the riverside during my breaks. I've also started to meditate on the fountain in Washington Square Park. I feel that both practices have had a beneficial effect on my disposition. I've begun to incorporate more fresh fruit and vegetables in my diet too, thanks to my local farmer's market. \n\nI found your description of my elemental nature quite accurate. I do make my living from working on difficult abstract problems.\n\n\"Your Saturn is very highly dignified, and its position in your natal grand cross dominates your chart, so your tendency to work in a context that seems to imprison you with worry, delay and responsibility is balanced by an inborn talent to succeed in matters where others would fear to even make an attempt.\"\n\nI found this very funny. I do always \"trap\" myself in work places where I hold a lot of responsibility. Without that feeling I feel like they don't really need me. I never realized this until U brought it up.\n\n\"These include: math, computer programming, cooking gourmet meals, fixing and building machines, and engineering.\"\n\nI did have the good fortunate to have a precociousness for mathematics and programming which has served me very well to this day. \n\n\"You'll find that you have an intuition about practical matters that you can't quite explain.\"\n\nI have found this. I've got a knack for putting physical objects together in useful combinations.\n\n\"Neptune trine Moon gives you a rich imagination, and Uranus trine Moon gives you an attraction to futuristic and technical things. Sci-fi/fantasy may be enjoyable, and since you're so serious you would also research the historical basis for magical ideas.\"\n\nI enjoy writing and reading science fiction.\n\n\"Your greatest enemy is inertia. Once you begin a project you're unstoppably persevering, but it can be easy to get in a comfortable rut, and you should make sure you're always tackling another mountain.\"\n\nI found this very good advice.\n\n\"Many people with these three planets in mutual aspect seem to be on the autism spectrum in my experience, is that true for you? It's likely that you feel held back emotionally and devote your energy to projects, possibly painting, writing or music, or something equally solitary and creative.\"\n\nI've never had a diagnosis as such but I do solitude when I can get it. A major area of work on myself for the past several years has involved becoming more of a people person, so I believe I have balanced that aspect of myself somewhat.\n\n\"I get the idea that frustrations or duties involving brothers and sisters, running errands, dealing with correspondence, getting around town, physical health issues like breathing and vision, and possibly a problem your mom has (Parkinson's is very Saturnian for example, or a mental health issue) may keep you tied down with a sense that you can't go too far in case you're needed, or in case you need someone else. But at the same time you may feel rejected and unappreciated. I kind of picture you taking care of a whole family as if you were the parent even though you're young, or in some way being blamed, or at least stuck with the consequences of, a misfortune that befell them. You love your home and family very much, but you may feel tied to it too tightly also.\"\n\nI did shoulder a financial burden for my family in order to make sure my three younger siblings would have an easier life than I did. I definitely began to feel the pressure to succeed and provide for my family from a young age. As early as 10 as I recall.\n\n\"You may worry about planning out your life, in case things go wrong and you're stuck for decades dealing with a responsibility that you find exhausting. So you're risk-averse, maybe not by choice, but also yearn to be able to shine as an individual, as a Sun in Leo person.\"\n\nVery true.\n\nYour advice concerning the Saturn-Moon I found very resonant. I did a lot of healing on that front a few years ago and feel so much better now. I definitely resented and pitied myself for the childhood I had, but I have come to see my background as a strength that I can draw upon. \n\n\"Okay, next is Mercury retrograde square Saturn. This simply means you have a love of the obscure, antique, mysterious, and serious, and you put a lot of work into your craft. On the plus side, Venus is conjunct your Mercury, and if you feel blocked in one area things flow with lucid brilliance in another. Beautiful lyrics and poetry would be good for you; you should learn an instrument; you should take up an artform. It will change your life for the better. Saturn opposite Venus means you could be intimidated by the highly technical and virtuoso skill you'd like to achieve, but go for it anyway.\"\n\nI appreciated hearing this. I have begun to play the melodica while I wait for my hang drum to arrive. I think I will greatly enjoy having music in my life.\n\n\"Saturn opposite Venus and square your Moon could make relationships with women somewhat uncomfortable. Perhaps you like flambouyant Venus-in-Leo type women, but are too shy to approach them since they seem like goddesses.\"\n\nI found this advice helpful and resonant. \n\n\"Do you have any interest in illustrating occult graphic novels btw?\"\n\nI do. I find graphic novels my favorite medium and have certainly read a fair number of occult graphic novels. \n\n\"You know how much trouble the world is in, how imperiled our future is; you don't hide in shallow diversions and pretend all that is happening somewhere else, to someone else.\"\n\nI definitely feel that motivation as a call to improve myself for the sake of the world.\n\n\"Pluto square Mercury and opposite Luna makes you a natural psychologist, specifically because you see beneath appearances to the hidden source of phenomena, including human motivation.\"\n\nYes, I definitely have a sense for people's motives. \n\n\"Okay, to sum up, you're a structured and methodical thinker with a creative and artistic streak, and you have a lot of opposite, contrary tendencies to reconcile. You're both self-denying and luxurious, for example. You're reserved but filled with an inner passion. Feeling torn between conflicting tendencies can sometimes make you feel stuck. You might look for a glamorous, quicksilver person to inspire or lead you out of this rut. You need to take better care of yourself, and surround yourself with water to make up for its lack of emphasis in your nativity. This wateriness includes love and compassion!\"\n\nA good summary!\n\n\"Oh, I should mention people fear you because you notice their mistakes. It might be prudent not to actually point them out to coworkers, though, unless you work in quality control; their egos, once bruised, may turn them into enemies.\"\n\nYeah, I don't even need to point out mistakes. I've become very nice about it, because noticing mistakes all around me used to make me feel cynical. I found that simply doing something better where they can observe me allows them to correct the mistake without loss of face. As U mentioned, I've definitely found surprisingly amounts of power in positive speech. \n\n\"Some will take it as a challenge eeven when you're not starting anything, and you may find yourself in the middle of a pissing contest without knowing how you got there.\"\n\nI will keep my eye out for this. I've started to notice this myself as a result of my martial arts training. It seems other people can sense the training I've had (so I need to work on better concealing it) and react to it. \n\n\"Your Mars is opposite Pluto, giving it extra power from the subterranean depths. You may be content to stay still and placid for awhile, but eventually something from deep within you erupts, sometimes to devastating effect. Nevertheless your burn is a slow and steady burn, and some may think you're indolent when really you're just biding your time. Mars in Taurus is also very sexy in that earthy physical way that loves to possess what he desires. You like a lover you can count on, someone who always wants you and who loves both your body and their own. Head games are not going to work on you. As far as you're concerned, if they don't know what they want then they don't deserve you.\n\nA lot of resonances here.\n\n\"Mars trine your Sun gives your chart a nice balance since Saturn aspects so many of your planets. In effect, you more feminine planets, Luna and Venus, are tied down by restrictive Saturn energy, while your masculine Sun is given the focus and drive of Mars. This is another way you may feel as though you have a contradictory nature: one part of you somewhat conservative and withdrawn, another part filled with a zest for life and a visionary sense of the good and true that scorns the limits of the practical and safe and wishes to lead others into a brighter future. I would say, let each part of you have its turn expressing itself and honor it on its own terms, because all have something valid to offer in the right context.\"\n\nI found this summary very useful as well.","name":"0","updated":{"$date":"2014-10-05T19:45:48.112Z"}}

We ended up at this strange church where they planned something bad. In order to escape I showed them how to use RSPEC, but then we ran to the black church that they planned to destroy and warned them. Then on the way back home we passed the original church again and I hide to very still because someone looked out the window, fortunately they didn't find me. Mark runs very fast and had a good ability to jump over fences, I had trouble keeping up with his speed in the dream. Before we got into the weird church business the kids and I tried to play with lego mindstorms and build something while mom and dad had some sort of argument. I also remember having to fly back the day before classes began again at dev bootcamp and feeling stressed out about that. I remember going with some friends to a restaurant inside of a museum. The menu seemed pretty expensive to me, but I just ordered this gyro wrap that cost $14 and they considered that a cheap menu item, very strange. \n\n10:13:51 AM: My mind feels rather empty this morning and I have a full day ahead of me, so I think I will take Dr. Morris's advice and do the KAP meditation right now since I woke up recently.\n\n10:38:18 AM: Good KAP meditation, only went through the chakra activation because it started to get too hot while wearing my sweater. Interestingly when I concentrate on certain chakras I get thoughts related to those chakras. I think I need to speak up about my NT time, that came up while trying to focus on my throat chakra. Once again I felt my crown strongly, a new feeling for me, so pretty exciting. I feel like I still need more help pinpointing where my solar plexus and stomach chakras reside as I can't quite feel the energy down there. \n\n12:55:10 PM: Had fun making the enhanced edition of the pheromone protocol. It seems to work pretty well, I have listened to it about twice while reading Sandman. I think I will workout a bit and then eat lunch and take a stroll in the park. \n\n4:04:24 PM: Feeling good. I finally replied to UnaInOmnia, maybe I can finally develop those job descriptions for Erin too. \n\n10:36:15 PM: Had an interesting time at the Temple of Thelema event. I felt slightly underwhelmed, but I suppose it served as an introduction to lay people because I felt like I had a lot of the information already. But I really enjoyed meeting Ayesha (sp?) I don't know how to spell her name. But I guess she works for an acting class where people learned how to channel archetypes and use their intent and energy. Very interesting that. I may have said some things I might regret to Daria, I don't know. I don't know how to feel about her. I do luv her. I just don't know if she will luv the person I most want to become. I saw Enrico again, and he mentioned that Ayesha also participates in the Temple, so I have some motivation to join. I guess the people who seemed to have their shit together had involvement in the temple. Several people mentioned Robert Anton Wilson today which made me feel happy. Paul Foster Case, I need to look him up. I pulled out my line about Devices and people seemed to appreciate the thought. \n\n11:41:58 PM: Good times, beat myself in Self-Mastery again. Woot.

Then I spent some nice time outside in the sun. An hour or so, and I began reading Schwaller de Lubicz's great book on symbology which I honestly don't think I understand yet but which I eventually hope to grasp. Probably to aid the development of my right brain I ought to start learning to draw using the book Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain (drawing could also mean drawing upon, which I certainly mean to do) and playing my hangdrum when it finally arrives. I ought to check in on the timing of that as I would like to receive it soon.\n\n3:08:39 PM: I feel happy that I have NT time as I have really enjoyed having some more time to myself already  and after I finish digesting all this food I would like to get a lot of practice and exercise done and beat my score from yesterday. Maybe I could even make it to some of Igancio's afternoon classes on this new schedule. I would definitely enjoy that. \n\n8:25:08 PM: Immediately after I wrote the entry above I ended up blowing my load to Abigaile Johnson, not the most skilled thing I've done. Also I napped for several hours. I figured out afterwards that eating all that delicious Vietnamese food left me in a serious food coma. I got so dehydrated that I couldn't think properly. I had to drink so much water before going to class and still felt a bit demotivated during class. \n\n8:38:14 PM: Class today I found pretty interesting. We went over these techniques based off jumonji where we received and then shifted in to do some crazy damage. I admire Nicole's stick-to-itness I think she will get far in this art. Also... she made some Freudian slips today? She told me to \"fuck her\" and also that she keeps getting \"drawn closer to U\". Very interesting... I mean, I definitely like her, but she has a husband already so I don't know what to do about that situation. I will just continue working on myself and see how things play out. I feel interested in investigating the Temple of Thelema now that I've met Ayesha. \n\n9:38:13 PM: Josh said I \"used strong kamae\" today. Pretty awesome!\n\n11:56:31 PM: Seems like David Kosky got my windpipe a bit today. Training with him can feel risky sometimes.

Had some more dreams with magic involved. Had a dream where I wandered through this big hotel looking for Uncle Jack and I called home and Priscilla told me that he lived on the sixth floor of the hotel and that he lived under this strange pseudonym that I shouldn't forget. Maybe I should try to connect with Uncle Jack as part of an ancestral working. He certainly did well for himself during his life, perhaps the closest person in my family to a sage. Dreamed about running and escaping from some people. Dreamed some more about playing Mtg with a friend. \n\n2:11:12 PM: ILUVU Aliza. Had an interesting meeting today with Jon from Bamboo who does technical recruiting. I told him that I feel pretty dedicated to Dev Bootcamp and don't really see myself going elsewhere.

The upstairs neighbors keep making strange noises. But I think more than that I just have a lot of thoughts on my mind. I felt pretty bummed out by the conversation I had with Daria tonight where she talked about how she didn't feel like she wanted to continue with tech and just felt really discouraged overall, and it just made me question whether we really had a long term future together. I feel like I want a woman that I admire and look up to and who doesn't push me to get better but just inspires me to get better because she follows her true will. I really hoped that Daria would get her psychic game together during the year off she had from school, but it didn't seem like she had much interest in spirituality or anything that I could offer her in terms of getting her mind in a better place. And honestly I feel pretty perturbed that now she takes Ambien in order to get sleep. I just feel like she has started to collect a lot of unhealthy choices. I just wish that I enjoyed conversing with her, but honestly I feel like we have very little to talk about ever and I find it a struggle to feel like I had an intellectual conversation with her. I feel terrible because I really do luv her a lot but I just feel like our long term goals have poor alignment. She wants to have a barn full of cats... I just don't luv cats that much. I would much rather do lots of cool things and not have to worry about a herd of cats that I have to take care of. \n\n1:40:11 AM: I feel pretty happy about the email that the founder of Datsusara sent me though. It seems like he liked some of my suggestions, and I will follow up with an email to him. I really like his blog and his wall of heroes I find that a super cool and inspiring concept.\n\n1:40:53 AM: Anyway, thank U for listening to me. It feels good to get these thoughts out and I feel really grateful for all the luv and care U give me. I think I should have an easier time getting to sleep now. I certainly have a lot to do tomorrow. \n\n1:41:29 AM: I feel like I need to break up with Daria at some point I just don't know when a good time would appear, because seriously, could a good time ever exist? Maybe over winter break. I certainly wouldn't want to put it off until summer when she might want to come live with me again. I don't know. I just want her to get better. I feel disappointed that she didn't turn out like the person I thought she seemed like. My own fault though. \n\n6:56:03 AM: Dreamed about a MCGT or maybe Davidson gathering at this futuristic city. Joe Norby and I wanted to go play golf. The city had these incredibly cramped walk ways that I wheeled a bike around. I dreamed that I studied with Tao. I hear a strange ringing in my ear. I think I might sleep a little longer.\n\n8:27:44 AM: I dreamed that DBC moved to a different location. I got drawn upon at like 5:20 to give a basic lecture on string manipulation in Ruby but somehow I had to go run and grab my computer and I could only find my old netbook which had all these weird problems when I tried to project like whenever I plugged in the VGA or the power cable a strange program would pop up like old games I used to make and none of the interactive prompts worked right and I couldn't even show them adding two strings together I tried to use \"appendTo\" in Ruby. Then I went to grab my macbook and it took me a while to find and we only had fifteen minutes left and all these german language videos popped up and it became this big joke about how I missed Stefan except I said Myles. I said Ich studiert Deutsch. One of the games that popped up seemed like some derivative of Dungeon Crawl I made so that I wouldn't die as much and it had all these really cheesy splash screens that had pictures of my face in them. Sarah attended the lecture as did a bunch of the mud turtles  it seemed.\n\n3:19:08 PM: Great meeting with Lloyd today, we talked about some interesting issues. We might have a little EE with all the staff to mend the distrust between the ops team and the rest of the staff. I had a really great conversation with Tess Manning over some tea. She works at Timehop now, they just raised $10 million and want to hire 15 people so she reached out since she remembered my work at Sailthru. I told her I feel quite happy at Sailthru, but I did ask about summer internships because maybe Daria would have an interest in working there. \n\n3:21:59 PM: I have $40 in charity today. $20 to the woman on Williams street that I always see, and another $20 to an old man whose sign said he fought for the US in vietnam. He seemed very happy afterwards and said he would have a great day. It made me feel really good. I feel glad that I did it, and my Guanyin amulet must have some crazy charge on it now. Great for them, great for me. MUTUAL BENEFIT!!!! Anyway, feeling good overall. Excited to see Daria. \n\n4:40:45 PM: Oh yeah, I forgot to mention this, but during my walk to see Tess I had a long bout of extremely clear vision. At one point my vision got really clear, my eyes started to burn, and I expelled a ton of tears, but my vision remained clear for the next fifteen minutes or so. Seems like my eyes have started to undergo some detox and squeezed out a bunch of shit. I feel very confident that soon I will have perfectly clear vision. After all the Taoist sages that trained Wang Li Ping mentioned that one of the qualities they look for in adepts includes bright eyes and strong teeth. So I think as I fill up with energy my eyesight will return to the natural strength I had as a child. This weekend's energy workshop with Tao Semko will help improve my eyesight and energy drastically I expect.\n\n9:55:07 PM: I feel pretty pleased with myself right now. I fixed a major issue with this wiki... however, preview no longer seems to work, seems like the keybinding doesn't trigger. Need to look into that.\n\n10:04:15 PM: Okay, now I feel especially proud. I think it all works quite well now. Like I can actually do this without it crapping out. \n\n10:43:50 PM: Well, now I feel pretty awesome. I have fixed up this wiki software a bit and I feel like it works way better now. And I have set the highest score yet on Self-Mastree, which I feel awesome about. I feel a little bit like I should have taught Daria how to concentrate better, because it seems like doing her homework would take a while if she keeps getting distracted by the internet, and I certainly know how that goes because it happened to me in college and still happens occasionally. Yeah, I definitely think I made some huge quality of life improvements here.","name":"6","updated":{"$date":"2014-10-10T02:45:15.806Z"}}

Given the powerful position of Saturn I have a lot of lead to transform into the gold. \n\n9:28:56 PM: When meditating on certain geometric figures, such as the connections between any number of points I get this interesting effect where some lines will fade out so that I can see certain faces within the figure. I suppose that indicates the activity of the right side of my brain truly analyzing the figure in a holistic fashion. I find it very fascinating and will certainly enjoy meditating on more mathematical objects.\n\n10:44:57 PM: Really enjoying this book so far. Great stuff. I think that I will do the KAP meditation soon and then head off to sleep. I will just do a little practice round for tomorrow and then head off to bed, maybe do some reading while in bed. I feel pretty good about all the work I did today, no point in needlessly pushing myself just so I can beat the score I set yesterday, since I probably won't have time to beat any score I set today tomorrow.

I feel very excited for what tomorrow will bring since Tao got start with the research that Dr. Morris had already done and work from there so I expect that he will have some very powerful techniques and information to share with us and I just feel happy to establish a relationship with him because I think his guidance will prove very useful as I go through the kundalini awakening process. I fully intend to have a functioning and powerful kundalini in a short period of time so that I may accelerate the pace at which I can manifest my true will and help humanity.

I dreamed that I went to some hard math class that I had trouble getting to because I had to climb up a ledge and get to it through a tunnel in the subway system. I saw Martin Camacho there and we talked about the homework. I dreamed about a porn site with terrible navigation and that some girl learned about penises from her mom. I dreamed that Daria transferred to Princeton. I dreamed of this strategy game that felt like a combination of star craft and magic the gathering where I mind controlled the enemy units and then sent my tanks and his units to go blow up his building and I collected some gold bars from looting. \n\n8:26:31 AM: Woke up today with a crazy cramp in my left leg, I guess it balances out the one I got in my right leg. I guess my legs have started to reconfigure to become strong. I don't know if I think I should work out before these seminars or not. Maybe just a little bit. But definitely I will do some taijutsu before I go. \n\n6:32:07 PM: Well now. Had a very interesting day so far. I met Alan Antopol in person at the seminar, which I didn't exactly expect. He looks a bit out of shape, I wonder why all these taijutsu guys end up with a gut? I guess I will stick to my convict conditioning and escape that fate. John, an old dude from Colorado who does consulting for nonprofits that deal with homelessness came. I met Carlie, she had a strong energy field when I felt for her aura. I felt a lot of heavy energy around her upper back, later when Tao did an energy cleaning on her (interestingly he used an orgonite accumulator to eat up the heavy energy after removing it from Carlie) he mostly concentrated on removing the heavy energy from her upper back. So it seems I really can sense energy in a way that other people can confirm. Very interesting. I had very strong feelings during the five point breathing tutorial Tao showed us, very cool pattern of breathing in a pentagram that I found really powerful. Seems like I could pull in a  lot of chi that way. Elana brought a nice skeptical attitude. Stefan seemed disengaged towards the end, I guess he just wants martial applications. He studies bujinkan at Musoza and apparently has done it for a while without great results due to lack of application. I went out to lunch with Clemens who just started Taijutsu, Tao, Alan, and John. We went to the mexican place on university and like 12th. Tao presented a slightly different ordering for the five feelings in the secret smile which worked pretty well but I think I will stick to the original because I have practiced with it a lot already. Something that I really got a lot of value from: Tao mentioned the third cycle in addition to just the fire orbit and the water orbit: the wind orbit which goes up the central channel rather than up the back and then descends down the front. I found that a lot more comfortable than the fire channel, but I also felt good knowing that I could just do the water channel if that fit me better. I get the feeling that I have more yin energy than most men. Due to the lighting conditions I didn't get a good look at Tao's aura at any point, but he felt fairly powerful. Especially after he did some squats. The qigong breathing exercises we did definitely generated some nice energy so I think I will keep doing those for sure, and the self massage certainly couldn't hurt either. \n\n6:51:43 PM: Oh, just remembered something funny. That time I dreamed about Reid Covington we stopped in the small town bodega to buy some Cherry Coke. Turns out he luvs cherry coke. Weird right?\n\n8:54:15 PM: Well, I think I will try to do the big 6 movements with coordination of the breath like in five points breathing. Tao says this will give me super strength if I learn to coordinate my movements with the qi as it will allow me to recruit a greater percentage of my muscle fibers in my movements. Perfect for me because I want as much strength as I can comfortably conceal. \n\n11:43:40 PM: Seems like my head movement makes a huge difference when doing all of these movements. Like the problems I have with going into ichimonji on the side go away if I turn my head first. ","name":"4","updated":{"$date":"2014-10-12T03:44:07.381Z"}}

I dreamed that I attended a university again and I worked with Kana on some theoretical computing models on molecules and we read a paper about probabilities forming themselves as synapse networks. Not entirely sure what the means. Also I had a weird audio setup that ran through the hallways, and they tried to kick some did out named Jordan for pirating music and I helped him hide along with Daria.\n\n10:51:44 PM: Well, well, what an interesting day. I will start my laundry and then tell U about it. \n\n10:56:06 PM: Okay, so... we went over the chakras today, and I think I've finally started to develop a feel for the lower chakras. Confusingly the solar plexus chakra can occur at the navel or higher up on the solar plexus it seems. Tao recommends picking either a radiant or fiery visualization for that depending on what we find appropriate. I seem to like the sun as my visualization. We did some interesting work with mixing the earth and the water, making the earth lava and a bit hot which I found very interesting, and letting the steam rise up to the chest and condense back down to the water. The throat chakra apparently holds a lot of power if I can learn to use it, because it lets me sense the volume and space within a room and around me, and obviously learning to use the voice in esoteric ways will hold a great deal of power. As for the third eye, I certainly got a lot of feeling and sensation inside of it and the crown chakra but I still haven't quite figured out how to use it yet. \n\n11:03:45 PM: Huh. I guess I lost my Guanyin amulet without realizing it... but I guess I just traded up, because this good luck coin that Carlie gave me kicks ass. Yeah, totally an upgrade. The Guanyin amulet had the following blessings (which I feel still apply, because Guanyin obviously still luvs me, and if anything I gave away the amulet in charity without thinking about it, awesome) \"Lifetime Peace\", \"Work Smoothly\". Both good charms, of course, definitely appreciated and I have really benefitted from those boons, praise to Guanyin. But now I've got \"ALL TOTAL COMPLETE PERFECT\", \"HARMONY WONDER SAFETY KINDNESS JOY VITALITY\" Bad freaking ass. Anyway, time to checkout the KAP materials!\n\n11:16:22 PM: So Carlie's husband Twig owns and operates one of the two sensory depravation chambers in Maryland. Pretty freaking cool. He also works on building Salvia tinctures that will make salvia accessible to people. I also met his friend Spiro who I found rather mysterious, I don't know much about him really. Apparently Twig and Spiro visited the Rueben museum. I really ought to go there sometime soon. \n\n11:20:33 PM: I had a good conversation with Alan after dinner, he wants to keep in touch which I feel fine with. He asked about where and when Josh holds class. \n\n11:21:44 PM: I learned some interesting ideas like I can totally run both directions of the orbit at once. I feel like Tao in a way suggested that I do the wind orbit since he only brought it up when I asked about orbits, and it feels like it works really well for me. Interesting to hear Tao talk about how he can feel people over distances and such. Very interesting. \n\n10:49:02 AM: Chakrasana or \"wheel pose\" literally means CHAKRA pose, haha.","name":"2","updated":{"$date":"2014-10-13T14:49:19.764Z"}}

I did her in doggy style which we both enjoyed pretty well. We did it in this strange sort of modular hotel room, by the time I came back to the room after leaving they had already started taking it apart. At the front desk while I went along my way back the guys at the desk had a semi hard time making sure that I really belonged at the hotel. The hotel had an interesting layout. U got a block number and then within the block they had tons of these modular rooms. I dreamed of a city that seemed like Taiwan and it just overflowed with traffic and people. I observed it from the sky. Not sure of the context there. I dreamed that I taught KAP techniques at Dev Bootcamp. I dreamed that a student of mine read my website and got really offended at one of my pieces of prose, but then also liked another one. She seemed kind of bipolar about it. She called my use of the word 'luv' violent. I tried not to take it too seriously. \n\n9:42:48 AM: Okay, weird. Remember how Tao mentioned lightbulbs blowing up? I just flicked the lightswitch in the bedroom and the lightbulb popped. Freaky. \n\n9:44:16 AM: I need to prioritize what I will do today. \n\n3:25:17 PM: Wow, Sandman vol 9 really went crazy. What a great series. Now I have to figure out what the hell to do until taijutsu. I feel a bit tired, not quite sure why. So dark outside. \n\n5:31:23 PM: Had some strange dreams about DBC and KAP after I semi drifted in and out of sleep during the KAP meditation. I find it entirely too dark in this apartment lately. I will definitely need to replace the lightbulb in the bedroom soon because it gets so dark in there now. Very dark in this room already and it hasn't even gotten to six yet.

These two professors of rationality or something really make themselves thorns in people's sides but they end up becoming investigators. Due to their use of science they actually have really good physical skills. They taught me how to move effectively and do parkour by controlling the center of gravity. At one point their boat got pursued by two beautiful women and they escaped onto a highway and it became a car chase and then a parkour chase. I also dreamed that I needed to fly somewhere and arrange with mom how to pick me up. I dreamed that I spent some time with my family again, in a car somewhere. In the book/movie the professor got suspended for a month from the school because he got into a fist fight with a bunch of religious people whose hypocrisies he pointed out.

Then I started connecting the chakras. Seems like it really works way better for me to go from top to bottom. I did the secret smile and started orbiting, and then I integrated 5 point breathing. Felt very powerful. Then I started breathing in and out of the front of every chakra starting from the top to get them all open. \n\n4:48:31 PM: Pretty interesting that during Mercury Retrograde my phone stopped working.

I dreamed that I talked to some people about various ways they would hack music subscription services so they wouldn't need to pay as much to get whole albums.

I ran away from the scene of the riot and that crazy guy using that strange dream run that happens, and I ended up somewhere approximately like Saddlewood, where I found a grove of trees that had a big tree house like contraption built up on it. I climbed up this ladder made of two big logs and a bunch of sticks, and I found that about 18 feet up someone had built a whole lot of structure. Then Mark joined me up on the tree, and we decided that it didn't feel that safe and that we should get down, except all the structure started to fall apart as we made our way down, but then I looked down and realized it didn't seem that high and just jumped down. By the time we got to the ground it looked really short and we just sort of laughed at how our perspective changed. Metaphor for growing up? But I saw that and it seemed really strange, so I said to Mark \"U realize we are dreaming, right?\" And he said yes, so I said let's go sledding, and we tried to make it snow by visualizing and I tried saying \"it feels white and slushy now\" but I just managed to grow thick bunches of white flowers in the grass instead of snow, but we did manage to materialize our sleds out of nowhere by believing that we would find them lying out there. \n\n6:29:45 PM: Had a good time at DBC for a few hours.

Some kind of strange drug got involved in the beginning, and due to its influence we had to hurry or many people seemed doomed. I drove a car speeding away from a scene that the police got dispatched to, driving past two police cars. I drove the car up a steep hill/mountain until I reached a point where the terrain became impassable due to these huge wooden constructions built by ancient people. The wood constructions seemed like an obstacle course or a wall, which I worked my way through. I took a lot of damage on the way through, getting impaled by a lot of arrows. I saw a lot of animals going through the wooden structure. A hyena, a rabbit, a cat. I got through the structure and made a run up the mountain, passing by Andy's parents house. At the top of the mountain, confusingly I found Priscilla's bedroom and I began searching the file cabinets for what I sought. Mark said he would help me find it. \n\n6:54:48 AM: During the night I woke up  and felt kundalini active and working on me.

Because the parasympathetic nerve system causes the pupils to contract which causes better focus. So at Ignacio's I saw Mike and Nicole. I learned some important points, like when doing kamae I need to take the pressure off my knee by moving into the growth along my outer edge of my leg and strength the outer edge of the knee. Also, when doing gyokko ryu ichimonji I need to relax the shoulder back so that my elbow can point down properly instead of to the side. Also when doing gyaku nuki I have to make sure to get on the line before the draw occurs. Right now I try to draw from the side.

I think I should probably do a LRBP and some meditation to shake it off and get on with my own life. I feel a little apprehensive because the astrology forecast I got from UnaInOmnia had some interesting potential pitfalls for my relationship, and it does make me question whether I really serve myself in my current relationship. I don't quite know what to do, but I will press on. \n\n12:31:58 AM: Well, I certainly feel better after doing the LBRP and did some stretching besides. Now I think I will go do massage, KAP, and bed.\n\n7:01:32 AM: Interesting dream. I taught physical therapy at DBC. I went home to Saddlewood where dad saw Einstein in the streets. Actually Einstein attends some sort of club that dad goes to like journal club and he sees him every week. Someone started flying an experimental aircraft, looked like an early WW2 biplane during a very windy day and it crash landed in our neighbor's house, our family ran out to rescue. Priscilla tried to help and we all felt concerned for her safety as she tried to protect a dog from a really dangerous live wire so I ran in to remove the dog. One of my mom's sisters and her husband met our family. And she joking told us about how her husband cheats on her with another married woman and will go travel to see that married woman for a few weeks, but she still luvs him and he made up for it by saying he would miss her and the kids and then got a haircut that looked like the same one her and her kids had. Also some kind of drama about OHS. \n\n8:28:28 AM: Strong KAP meditation this morning. Pretty good concentration. During the tensing I really felt the results of my recent strength training because I innervated my nerves really strongly and got super tense, took a little while to relax it all but I released a lot of energy that way and it felt super power. Had a pretty good secret smile today, did the wind orbit, started five point breathing early. Overall, good session. \n\n11:41:46 AM: Dreamed Mike and I attended James's wedding/going away party. I encountered a ton of creepy spiders in this grungy bedroom. I encountered a former tutoring client of me that I did AMC tests with. Alec? Mike and I discussed some books. Interesting book called \"On Presence\" mentioned by some Trudy character. Book doesn't exist. I remember a quote standing out and talking to Mike about it. My parents attended the wedding ceremony too, and I left my calculator with them (TI 89). \n\n5:13:04 PM: I dreamed I went to some kind of party with a lot of Sailthru people. And I saw someone that looked like or had some relation to Jaselyn and she asked me about Daria and I introduced her to Daria. At the Sailthru party people kept telling me how things had gone down hill and I said that I felt pretty happy that I had left. I saw Danny there.

This is the most rare personality type of all, only 1 percent of the population has it.\n\nThey like to organize their outer world in categories and priorities they never stop redefining. However, they have a great intuition and deal with their inner life very spontaneously. They perceive and understand things very intuitively and are very rarely wrong about their intuitions. This dichotomy between their inner and outer life may result in INFJs being less organized than other Judging types.\n\nBecause of their great instincts, INFJs understand people and situations very easily. They often feel when something has happened to some of their friends of family members even if they cannot really explain to themselves how they perceived it. Those strong intuitive capabilities may lead them sometimes to stubbornness and ignoring other people's opinions since they trust their instincts above everything else. This attitude should not be perceived as arrogance as INFJs are perfectionists and think they should always improve themselves and the world around.\n\nINFJs set up a strong value system for themselves and always care about living in accordance with their values and ideals. They are warm and easy going as long as they do not have to compromise their values.\n\nWarm and caring, they hate conflicts and will avoid hurting people. They will generally internalize their anger which can be a source of stress and health problems for them.\n\nIn the work place, most INFJs show up in creative and independent positions. They are good at art and sciences where they can use their intuition at best. They are generally bad at dealing with details and prefer working on the big picture.\n\nINFJs are natural nurturers, protective and devoted. They make loving parents and build strong bonds with their children.","name":"1","updated":{"$date":"2014-10-31T03:36:25.448Z"}}

Maybe their means of exploration are just different - in fact, I'm sure they're different, because of the infinite spectrum of ways to experience infinite new consciousness.","name":"1","updated":{"$date":"2014-11-25T02:07:24.801Z"}}

I struggled with this concept, because I consider myself rational despite holding beliefs that self proclaimed leaders in a so called \"Rationality Movement\" consider irrational.\n\nFor instance: Sam Harris, who I believe considers himself rational, claims I can't truly make choices. I believe I can truly make choices. I consider myself rational. Can we both justifiably consider ourselves rational and disagree on such a fundamental proposition?\n\nI believe we can, provided we define rationality carefully. I have defined rationality as: how we measure the alignment of our choices with our values.\n\nI considered that the word 'rational' contains the root 'ratio' and thus involves comparison between two things (as forming a ratio between two numbers provides a relative measurement). Then I wondered, on what basis do we form this comparison?\n\nI believe economists use this definition, and they choose profit or utility as their value (base of comparison). I dislike their brand of rationality because I perceive it as leading to greed. But I concede that they act rationally given their values.\n\nI guess that Sam Harris values alignment with Western science more than I do. Thus he finds it rational to fit his beliefs into a mechanistic view of the universe, whereas I find it rational to keep my beliefs unrestricted from any specific model of reality because I value freedom and openness.\n\nI bet I value harmony more than Sam Harris, since Sam speaks against other people's beliefs. I believe he acts rationally, in doing so. And I believe I act rationally in not doing so.\n\nIn conclusion I will never to judge another person's rationality until I know their value system. Better yet, I will never judge another person's rationality, and instead use their actions to deduce their values assuming their rationality.

,{"_id":"q3cSB47mCBWHyRckz","active":true,"url":"golden_flower_meditation","prose":"tMKSZxAXFnfF5JXHn","text":"Instructions adapted from chapter 4 of The Secret of the Golden Flower as translated by Thomas Cleary. In my experience this meditation takes me deep.\n\n1. This method just requires single-minded practice. One does not seek experiential proof, but experiential proof comes of itself.\n\n2. On the whole, beginners suffer from two kinds of problems: oblivion and distraction. To get rid of them, rest the mind on the breath.\n\n3. Can one have no thoughts? We can't cease to think. Can one not breathe? We can't cease to breathe. Nothing compares to making the affliction itself into medicine, which means to have the mind and breath rest of each other. \n\n4. When U sit, lower your eyelids and establish a point of reference. Now let go. But if U let go absolutely, U may lose the ability to simultaneously keep your mind on listening to your breath.\n\n5. U will not allow your breathing to actually sound audible; just listen to its soundlessness. Once U hear the breath, it buoys U and U do not enter the fine. Then  patiently lighten up a little. The more U let go, the greater the subtlety; and the greater the subtlety the deeper the quietude. \n\n6. Eventually, after a long time, all of a sudden even the subtle will disappear and the true \"breathing\" will appear, whereupon the substance of mind will become perceptible. \n\n7. Subtle mind makes subtle breath; unified mind moves energy. Subtle breath makes subtle mind; unified energy moves mind. \n\n8. U don't understand the meaning of the word _movement_. Movement means pulling the strings; the word _movement_ means _control_. Since U can cause movement by vigorous action, how could U not cause stillness by pure quietude?\n\n9. The life of the spirit comes from the prior death of the mind. If people can kill the mind, the original comes alive. Killing the mind does not mean quietism, it means undivided concentration. Buddha said, \"Place the mind on one point.\"\n\n10. If the mind tends to run off, then unify it by means of the breath; if the breath tends to become rough, then use the mind to make it fine. If U do this, how can the mind fail to stabilize?\n\n11. Generally speaking, the two afflictions of oblivion and distraction just require quieting practice to continue unbroken day after day until complete cessation and rest occur spontaneously. When U do not sit quietly, U may get distracted without knowing it; but once aware of it, distraction itself becomes a mechanism for getting rid of distraction. \n\n12. As for unawares oblivion and oblivion which U gain awareness of, there lies an inconceivable distance between them. Unawares oblivion means real oblivion; oblivion that U notice U can ward off.\n\n13. Whenever U sit, U will quiet your mind and unify your energy. How do U quiet the mind? Through the breathing, but the mind alone knows U when U breathe out and in; do not let the ears hear. When U don't hear it, the breathing becomes fine and the mind becomes clear. If U can hear it, the breathing sounds rough, which means a cloudy mind. \n\n14. This practice doesn't feel mechanical or forced. Just maintain a subtle looking and listening.\n\n15. What does \"looking\" mean? Eyes spontaneously shining, the eyes only looking inward and not outward. Not looking outward yet seeming alert means inward looking; one does not literally look within.\n\n16. What does \"listening\" mean? Ears spontaneously listening, the ears only listening inwards and not outwards. Not listening outward yet sounding alert means inward listening; one does not literally listen within.\n\n17. Listening means listening to the soundless; looking means looking at the formless.\n\n18. When U sink into oblivion and become drowsy, get up and take a walk. When your spirit has cleared, sit again. I recommend sitting for a while in the early morning when U have free time. After noontime, when we have many things to do, we can easily fall into oblivion. Also, U do not need to fix the length of time of meditation; U just need to set aside all involvements and sit quietly for a while. Eventually U will attain absorption and not become oblivious or sleepy.","name":"0","updated":{"$date":"2014-11-30T17:10:02.371Z"}}

The physicist seemed to fear for his life. When I pinned down the fan chasing him the fan told us how the physicist had a rare immunity to all forms of disease. Earlier in the dream I had gone to a math competition with my dad and the physicist where I did not do well, so we went to leave the competition and ended up having to run away from it. The competition took place in an epic looking library or train station with huge spiral stairs. The physicist told us a story about getting laid off as a waiter because he took too many liberties with the food he served, drinking rum and cokes, taking slices of cheese, etc. \n\nI dreamed of playing some sort of very realistic RPG game with my friends. I remember visiting a shop where we bought these disease masks that made our characters look really attractive and hacking the registers so it cost less, then we ran off to our van. We went to investigate a city under a plague. I think this tied in with the physicist. \n\n9:52:15 PM: Great jujitsu class today. I submitted both Hector and Amy, and passed them both. And I think I swept Amy, but I don't remember exactly. Against Amy I attacked her elbow and shoulder until she tapped. Against Hector I choked him using a rear choke. Today we learned an interesting sequence moving from cross choke to arm bar to triangle choke. Cool. We also did two drills that taught passing. I found those very useful and finally had an idea of how to pass today. We practiced the cross choke again, of course. \n\n11:32:28 PM: Did the KAP meditation, didn't consciously do most of it, but it seems like my subconscious took over because I still felt great when it ended. But it really sounded like after bringing the energy to my crown I didn't hear anything. I didn't hear the secret smile at all, too zoned out. But it feels like my body still performed it for me.\n\n11:33:26 PM: After jujitsu today I formed a theory about maybe why Dr. Morris found martial artists getting enlightened so frequently. I found that after doing a lot of physical activity rather than going with the normal way of things and panting to try to \"catch my breath\" instead I tried to go back to silent breathing right away. My theory: exercise brings up a lot of yang energy stored in the root or hara (not sure). Most people can't handle all that yang in their body so they breathe heavily to push it out of the body. Instead if I breathe quietly I can circulate that yang energy through my body and recharge my yang reserves instead of throwing that energy away. People get tired from their exercise precisely because they throw away their yang energy and then have to restore their balance of it. \n\n11:35:28 PM: Hm, I need to fix the bug with previews not working. \n\n12:01:47 AM: Happy to have fixed this bug. Very happy, as a matter of fact. Maybe I will get around to fixing the \"AM\" bug too, I would like that. But for now I have things functioning properly more or less, so I feel happy about that. Perhaps my dream of recursive tree editing will yet come. I have learned much from working on Self-Mastree that I can incorporate into the second iteration of the wiki. \n\n12:05:55 AM: Anyway, did just a little taijutsu on the principle that I should keep my breathing even.

I couldn't just leave my apartment because some people in it had three dogs in there with my cats. In a rush I tried to give them a set of keys so they could lock the doors after getting their dogs off because I had to run off, late already. The stairway out of the apartment building had all these weird portraits of someone's family. I left my apartment without shoes on, and the road to the subway got all ripped up by massive construction. All the construction workers played catch with little kids. One of the guys missed and I threw the ball back to him but he didn't catch it and it fell in a hole. I thought to myself that qi gong attracts aliens for some reason.

Hopefully she didn't feel too stressed that night but I want to apologize to her on Monday for not staying to help.

I saw Phil there again and I met a new friend named Andrew. I found Andrew a pretty tough opponent. We started with the two passing drills I had seen. The one where I stick my hand between his two legs, my other hand on his far knee and I pivot around him. Then the other one where I start with one knee placed on his stomach and I bring both knees to the stomach while bringing my feet up to my butt and then I place the other foot back on the ground. We also did the drill where we flip sides by pressing my forehead into the ground and kicking up while keeping my arm wrapped around their leg. Then we practiced the cross choke again.

Got over my cold a bit. Told a lightbulb joke today. The IT technician fixed the lightbulb by turning it off and then on again. Gave two solid lectures. Today I started lecture nine sharp so that people understand that I don't fuck around when it comes to starting on time. Of course I recorded the lecture so people could still catch up on it later. \n\n11:29:25 PM: I had a good time in class today. We covered muso dori and went back to basics because Steph Zhang showed up. Nice time. Seems like everyone likes her. Josh liked her too. I will bring her Kiso no Izen tomorrow.

I dreamed that I went home and I got in a huge argument with my parents about drugs and I couldn't find anywhere to watch porn which I apparently wanted to do so I said I hated it at home and I wanted to leave after only staying for two days but I couldn't figure out a good way to escape. \n\n10:50:24 AM: Today I will dedicate myself in service to Saturn/Scythe to finish up my work on RoyaltyReminder aided by the power of Mercury/Hermes/Jaeger.\n\n12:20:57 PM: Performed an invocation of Hermes before heading out with Daria to shaigon shack for some delicious vegetarian pho. Ended up walking to Urban Outfitters to grab some candles. I could put those to some good use in some ritual magick. I think I could cast a spell to bind a flame spirit to Daria to help her burn away her psychological and spiritual garbage. Daria has had good success with this practice of burning away what she doesn't need and I want to encourage it. Hopefully I can get her ready to meet the luv of her life soon.\n\n9:57:28 PM: Work on RoyaltyReminder has gone okay. I feel a little bit stuck today, but hopefully talking to Ethan tomorrow will unstick me. \n\n9:58:03 PM: The porn demon has decided to pay a visit, first in my dreams last night and persistently. I want to hold out for U to enter my life and not get sidetracked by such things. In a moment after I digest a little more (maybe I will go do some digestion meditation) I will do a strength circuit to hopefully siphon off some of this sexual energy. Strange too because Daria and I had great sex last night. She came and then I came a little while afterwards. For a moment I felt I could have just stopped and not came, but Daria seems to feel a little disappointed if I don't so I just went for it. Felt nice, for sure. \n\n10:00:06 PM: Good taijutsu class today at Josh's. Keno signed up but didn't show up. Rob and Kosky both showed up soon after me, Nicole showed up a while later. We practiced musha-dori today, which I still find very difficult. Hard to feel the opponent's balance and keep my own balance steady still. Josh made some interesting points though. We want to lock their hip up while going forward. We don't want their back shoulder to come forward. They shouldn't bend forward at the hips. If they can we should have done muso-dori instead. The forward arm could apply a strike or pressure to keep their back shoulder down, but that becomes a crutch to higher understanding. \n\n10:14:58 PM: I worked a bit on the content of the BHD densho forum. Currently I have started updating it to the latest build of Discourse. I will consider installing a tagging extension, but it could cause problems down the road so I might not.

Just a little bit. I dreamed about coding and dev bootcamp. \n\n12:36:31 PM: Good jujutsu class today. \n\n11:50:13 PM: Alright, well, I will do some journalling now since Daria still has work to do it would seem. I had a good jujutsu class where I met Dave, a pretty experienced white belt and we worked on the drills together. A woman named Karen came to visit and Sebastian took some time to give her a tour and show her the techniques, and then she worked in with Dave and I. She picked it up pretty fast, perhaps despite her disbelief. We practiced the two triangle escapes today. The triangle escape involving falling over onto one hip had a different twist today, I guess Sebastian teaches it differently than Russ. Russ had us grabbing the opponent's lapel from behind. I escaped Dave's triangle a few times, a few other times he choked me out. I never managed to pull a triangle on Dave, I don't feel super solid on doing triangles yet. After Dave I went up against Mark, an older guy who sort of reminds me of Dr. Morris (having never met him in real life). Larger dude, maybe twice my weight and looks in his fifties. We had two good matches, one that ended due to time, one where he got an interesting finish on me from behind. I found myself working pretty defensively against him. Against Dave at one point I found myself in turtle doing the daoist turtle breath to try to siphon energy off of him and tire him out. \n\n11:59:04 PM: Anyway, later on I had a nice meeting with Ethan at his apartment where I met his wife Barbara and I also saw Ezra and Manya again. Nice to see Manya, she came and said hello. I would like to catch up with her soon, I haven't really spoken to her in ages and she had a big role in my life when I first came to New York. Ethan offered to  pay me today which I politely declined because I feel like I haven't finished a successful first iteration yet. We discussed design and thankfully we share a common design sense so I will take the sites he suggested and steal their CSS. Good times. And I have a bunch of work to do still with the tagging system which I really need to figure out. Maybe I can extend some of that over to justatus though. So good times. \n\n12:02:42 AM: After I came home I helped Daria move more of her stuff back to the apartment. Which has given me a lot of mixed feelings. To speak completely honestly I feel a little bit cramped and I feel the clutter coming back into my life and I don't know what to do except wait and see if Daria really does throw out half her stuff like she claims that she wants to. I really like owning very little and I still feel like I own too much right now, hopefully one day I will reach the point where I own very little. I need to go to bed soon because I did not sleep well last night and I have work tomorrow and I feel like I have a lot to do tomorrow so I need some rest, I have a lot of JavaScript that I need to teach and I don't even know how to cover it all.

The doctor injected her with a warm fluid that made her feel a bit blissful and sedated, but she had some kind of plan up her sleeve. Somehow it didn't really affect the way they supposed it would and she would take action, in the mean time she pretended. I saw from the perspective of the girl. She had a huge book in her hands. Apparently she hacked a computer so that this procedure actually placed a lot of money in her own account.

I dreamed of seeing Randall with Melissa Dundan in a subway station. I dreamed of Paul Graham showing everyone on hacker news this trading program that pulled in all the stock exchanges and ran on ordinary laptops, before running it he closed all other programs. I dreamed of this huge building that uncle jack lived in where everyone who lives in it gets their money invested in the stock market as part of this automated scheme and the dividends and profit pay their rent. The building has huge stadium seating that overlooks the city and it towers above things. I snuck into the building and grabbed a set of maintenance keys left in a door and began exploring to find Uncle Jack's apartment. I dreamed of a game group and trying to meet up with them. \n\n10:50:48 AM: Lately I have fallen a bit behind in terms of both journalling and logging my activities. I have a lot to catch up on. So on Monday Daria and I made luv, and it felt really great for both of us I think. I came first but kept going and then she came. Good times. That night a spider appeared crawling on Daria and she freaked out, but I rescued it by letting it crawl onto me and then I placed it behind the trash can where I figured it could probably catch a lot of bugs. I felt really happy to have a spider in the house although Daria felt quite scared by it. I like spiders, I like them as a totem. I would like to research it a bit more.\n\n10:54:51 AM: Yesterday I had a long struggle but then I finally decided to go to jujutsu right in the nick of time. I felt really glad that I did, I think I would have regretted if I didn't. We learned about escaping from omaplata and learned about omaplata as a result. During sparing I met Brianna a far girl with bright pink hair (I felt amused, again the universe brings me an approximate result, so I will keep waiting). I submitted her five times in a row after I had a draw with Hector. I had two x-chokes off on her, some sort of shoulder lock (maybe americano?), choked from above once, and got an armbar too. I felt pretty good about how my body launched into those moves. Justin who I just met that class also submitted me once and then we had a draw due to time ending. Good times. \n\n11:07:40 AM: I have decided I want to watch Satoshi Kon's movies and Paranoia Agent during my break. I had an inkling that he made paranoia agent, funny that I suggested it to Jesse after watching Paprika not actually knowing he had made Paranoia Agent. Very interesting. I would like to watch all his films. Every Picture a Frame definitely showed how brilliant he seems at making cuts. \n\n11:09:31 AM: I need to practice YOU a little bit before I deliver it to my audience at Get Lofted, an open mic event that Mike Ketigian has organized. \n\n11:10:32 AM: Today we will interview the last candidate for the lead link position. So far I consider Erin in the lead, but we will have to see how this guy does. I find a little bit strange that Sam participates in these interviews given that he would work with Erin as a lead link, but I don't know what to think of that. Anyway, I felt a little bit disappointed that Sam turned out not the reluctant leader I thought but actually wanted the lead link role, but I can live with that. It gave me a different perspective on Sam as someone who does want to advance his career. I don't quite know what I want to do here, I think I would like to consult the yijing about my future. I would probably like to work more part time so I can devote more time to my own projects. \n\n11:13:27 AM: I feel pretty happy with Daria right now which I will savor before the Great Write kicks off. That will make it more of a sacrifice to truly lose someone I luv, but I still look forward to the future. ","name":"1","updated":{"$date":"2014-12-17T16:14:09.723Z"}}

I had a great day today. It has felt amazingly long. Gave a lecture in the morning where we implemented updating a task with AJAX on the ToDove app (also earlier in the week Ricky gave me a Rock Dove sticker that fits very well with the other stickers on my laptop). I got to meet Michael Scott who does HR and benefits for DBC now and felt good because he seems like a good guy who does want to help us out. Later I had a tactical meeting with the teachers where Steven Harms aired some of the frustrations that I felt, and I decided that I would move the NYC tactical meeting to Friday so that pretty much all our meetings could occur on Friday. Good times. I always find Friday a really dead day. I went to Open Kitchen for california rolls and then ate those while Todd interviewed for the lead link position. I had a very positive first impression of him from talking to him before the interview started with Sam, but as the interview dragged on I felt less and less confident in him, and later when discussing him with Zack and Kimberly I learned that Kimberly really doesn't want him and would rather have Erin, so I will cast my vote for Erin, who I feel sure can do a great job. \n\n12:05:54 AM: I felt nervous today about the timing of a few different things that all worked out in the end. I worried about the scheduling of a phone call from the Rumpl people, because I told them to call me at 12:30 when I would have actually felt quite busy. But they messed up the time zone conversation and schedule it for 3:30, but then actually ended up calling me at 4:30. Anyway, I had a chat with them and we discussed how they want to get a blog going on Rumpl, which I thought I could setup easily enough using Shopify. Obviously David from Oliver's has said good things about us because I got instant approval. \n\n12:08:48 AM: I met Katie today, the woman who will take over Sarah's role while she goes on maternity leave. She seems nice. Today we had the difficult conversations EE where I realized I have a lot of difficult conversations to have with Daria. \n\n12:09:28 AM: The other timing thing involved a conflict between taijutsu and Mike Ketigian's open mic tonight. I thought that I would have to arrive late to the open mic, and stinking from taijutsu sweat besides. But actually things worked out great. Everyone except me bailed on class so I showed up and had a one on one with Josh Polier that really helped me with ura gyaku and with tsuki. For ura gyaku when going forward it helps to angle the front leg like doing hira so that it pushes their leg to the side.The back arm needs to push their arm to the side. Transfer all weight to the front foot. Cross step should trap leg and coordinate with gyaku starting. When unfurling out back foot has to get back on the line, the front leg needs to maintain the contact to buckle their knee in. Get the wrist to 90 and crank the hand parallel to the ground. On tsuki I shouldn't swing the hand up so that it feels like chi no kata, it doesn't work like chi. I have to tsuki at any distance. Even if my tsuki stops half way it has to penetrate. \n\n12:26:00 AM: After class I had just enough time to shower, perform a lesser banishing ritual of the pentagram, invoke Hermes and then head off to open mic just in time to arrive right on time. All because Josh ended class because everything lined up because the universe really worked for me today because awesome. At the party I met Gerard who Mike had meant to introduce me to for a while. We hit it off right away talking about journaling. He told me about his experiences in a rain forest in Peru. I told him about my experience in the ayahausca circle. He told me about how during his ayahausca trip he astral projected and felt his point of consciousness leave his body like ungluing from a television screen. And then he communed with spirits. Good stuff. Anyway, I volunteered to go first and shared my poem YOU. I didn't actually deliver the whole thing because I totally forgot the refrains that started U, U, U, but it ended up working out fine. People thought I did a really good job. Also I got a lot of comments today on my posture while sitting on the benches. I guess I keep my back straight while sitting on chairs like that. I heard some beautiful singing. \n\n12:43:18 AM: I feel really excited to meet U soon. I can see the spell working and I now have a healthy sense of pronoia that if I keep living out my life the way I want I will meet U. \n\n12:44:03 AM: Daria has started yelling at the cats. I think she ought to sleep rather than continue to cram for this exam, but I don't really understand her approach to school anyway. \n\n12:45:49 AM: Anyway, the reason I know the spell has begun to work its magick: today I met a woman named Elisa, another close match on the name. Some great characteristics like her hair and her amazing voice. Seriously, she blew our minds with her signing. But anyway, she's not U. I can't wait to meet U, I know that I will recognize U when I see U. Interestingly a lot of women today said that I looked familiar. Not sure how they figured that. Maybe they just saw me on Facebook. A lot of great performances tonight, more than I can write about really, but I will try. Matt and his wife Joyce performed a duet. Joyce sang solo. Amber shared a story of working with a mentally retarded child and his mother, she does genetic counseling, and the child hugged his mom while she felt really guilty for drinking during his pregnancy and they tried to explain to her that she didn't cause it. Mike shared his Drink the Koolaid poem which he has declared finished. Ohan shared a new piece. I got to hear Jaime perform which I found amazing. Amanda shared a beautiful poem on beauty which really resonated. I told her about the line about beauty in the dao de jing. Leslie and Anna talked to me a bunch, Leslie definitely wanted to get in my pants, but no thanks. Nice enough girl but again, not U.\n\n7:39:21 AM: I dreamt of going to this crazy party/rave with Mike and some other people and every got really excited about this super professional molly dealer that had the straight dope. I took it and Daria took it and everyone took it. Daria didn't feel much thought due to her meds so she didn't have as great a time as the rest of us. I ate lunch with some well connected people who hooked up some more molly. We danced to at the rave. The dealer checks your ID before giving U the molly, interesting. I never paid, also funny. \n\n","name":"3","updated":{"$date":"2014-12-18T21:07:13.045Z"}}

Some interesting events transpired on the way home. On the airplane I met a woman named Allegra who had auburn hair. Still not U, but it feels like every day I get closer and closer. I have a theory about this. I think the significance of our meeting holds so much power that it creates shockwaves into the past and future around the event of our meeting. Currently I encounter echoes of our meeting. In fact these echoes have gone far back like when I met Aliza McKamey. I feel great excitement in finally reaching the epicenter of these shockwaves. \n\n3:09:35 AM: Erin got elected lead link. Cool times. I didn't do a lot at work today it felt like, but I did start the process of moving our tactical to next Friday. I think I would like to sleep soon. I really admire Luke based on what my parents have told me about what he has gotten up to lately. He seems like he could make a fantastic doctor and make med school look easy. \n\n3:14:38 PM: I dreamed a lot last night but I totally didn't record them this morning. Ah, but I remember going through this tower as a short cut to get to this store I went to with Zack Mance. We found this strange fruit candy laying out in front of the store. I remember it as a sunny day, fruit candy on the ground.

Also the students could just chime in and suggests questions and argue with the teacher about the point of the test and the questions. Very interesting. I also dreamed of working on my lectures for DBC. I also dreamed of visiting some fortune teller / psychic lady and working out with her the schedule for when I would visit.

He left a note in cypher at the scene of the murder so we started tracking him. Went sledding on a really high hill with an adult who had really strict rich parents growing up and I told him he had it easy, and he disagreed. Had a mock fight with a kid in my dream when I wore climbing shoes so I felt afraid to really kid him, but I did sort of kick him and won the fight and I felt bad about it afterwards because his brother came to take care of him and hated me for it. Mark and I hung out. Dad told us we could only have one cheese stick each. Andy and I planned to go to a guns seminar together and I hoped he would come to a kaceminar with me sometime. \n\n#### Yoga\n\n9:04:29 AM: Had class with Deanna today. My legs felt pretty tired, so during one of the leg balancing poses I decided to take a rest in child's pose. While I did that Deanna massaged my lower back right along the spine very gently, like she used a finger at a time. Then I felt a warm sensation traveling up inside my back along my spine. That felt like warm qi? It feels like I run cool qi most of the time. Will have to ask her about that. She also helped me on several poses that I found difficult, like the one where I balance on an arm and leg and lift the other arm and leg up. Daria and I both agree she sounds amazing. Her voice would sound great on a meditation mp3 or similar. \n\n#### Meditate\n\n9:13:39 AM: Okay, let's do a KAP meditation and see if I will concentrate strongly on it.\n\n10:56:26 AM: Well, I must admit that I still drifted off quite a lot during this. I think I can't do it while I feel so tired or I will just zone out because I have heard it so many times already. But I did still feel good at the end of it, so perhaps it still has some use. Perhaps the body follows along without my conscious intercession. \n\n#### Plan Day\n\n*Intention for the day*: Continue solidifying great habits, connect deeply with team and give and receive compassionately wherever possible.\n\n- [] Send in form to adopt kitkat.\n- [] Think more about how to arrange personal tree of life.\n- [] Draw out some sketches of DeftDraft.\n\n#### Sailthru\n\n- [] [9957](https://sailthru.fogbugz.com/default.asp?9577) Refactor the hell out of Netsuite because I love Lana and Bill.\n- [] Get sandbox setup on Macbook, because I love myself.

I haven't had a chance to work on RoyaltyReminder in a while. I would like to get to that soon, probably tomorrow. I would like to start my year end review soon too. \n\n1:40:34 AM: Didn't have much to discuss with Andy today it felt like, we played some magic, kind of interesting kind of not. I guess it seems a bit boring now, but we played three way games that felt pretty close with Priscilla playing with the sliver deck. And later Mark joined us and Priscilla left to make food for us to bring to the Spencer's. Mom and Priscilla didn't end up going to the spencer's with us because they felt tired/sick. I had an okay time there. I talked to Alec and Chris and a little bit with Kari. Alec has realized he doesn't love computer science and would rather have done mechanical engineering after he saw a job listing for spacex. Chris goes to Colby in Maine and does environmental science or maybe economics he hasn't really decided yet. After getting back in the evening dad had a talk with us about religion and life paths and such, and I had a chance to share some of my philosophy with my family.\n\n12:10:16 PM: Strange dream. I lived in some sort of city that sort of resembled New York, but not quite. I lived with some new  roommates, I don't know if I know any of them yet. Pretty sure I do, but I have forgotten who. This sketchy drug dealer sold my female roommate a whole suitcase full of heroin. I strongly caution her against it (apparently I have a history with it) and then we both snort small lines. She goes to lecture a group of people (in our apartment? strange, so I guess she worked as some sort of teacher). I felt really hungry so I went to look for the last slice of pizza that I bought from a pizza shop owned by a friend. I told my roommate about the dark night of the soul. I felt really weird from the heroin and felt like maybe the pizza could save me. By the time I found the pizza the sun had come out already. And I wanted to eat the pizza but a bunch of hungry people showed up so I ended up sharing most of the pizza, which I felt good about despite needing the pizza so much. Then I think the dream transitioned. I remember crossing this sewer that merged with a stream under a bridge. And then I started talking to a kid in rollerskates who has to manage the flow of the river and he talked about how they didn't have the man power to move the banks of the stream in order to redirect the flow of water. He had two adults working with him but they seemed to work very sluggishly and the kid just went around in rollerskates. At some point I found some jujitsu guys and I stared sparring with a tall blond guy. Then I found this phoney seeming martial artist with a sword and he showed us some incorrect sword kamae. Then Hatsumi showed up and things got really interesting. Hatsumi started showing us and the phoney sword guy who sword techniques with his very long sword. He let the poney attack him and then he disappeared behind one of those asian partitions, he also dodged the bare minimum amount of the phoney almost hit him. Several on lookers playing the role of enemies stayed behind the partition. So he rolled over the the top of the partition, slicing everyone behind it, and then got the phoney too. Daria and I both had our minds blown. Then we followed him to his house where he had a young child like a nephew or something living with him. They had so many very creative toys in that house that I looked at, like many psuedo-living toys. One snake like toy that when I dropped on the ground would wiggle around places for quite a while based on the momentum of the fall. And a lego mindstorm toy that would eat sounds. It would travel to the location of large noises and absorb energy from the sound waves.\n\n12:22:53 PM: I've never dreamed of Hatsumi. This feels very special and significant. Especially since so much of that dream seemed completely surprising to me I wonder if we made some sort of contact. ","name":"1","updated":{"$date":"2014-12-22T17:23:32.837Z"}}

I think I should carefully consider the size of projects that I take on while at work, because I could not handle the break down of my server while at work. Also I should learn to tolerate Katherine having fun while coding. \n\n11:54:59 PM: Class today with Cameron and James went okay, we worked on seminar techniques that we couldn't really do, then on some kihon happo that I still have trouble with and we did them the cameron style, which I always find interesting because they require a good sense of kizushi and timing.\n\n11:55:45 PM: Mostly glad just to have fixed this server and having my website back online with no loss of data, I seriously felt worried for a moment. But I also felt oddly not that attached to losing all my writing, which I think indicates a level of emotional maturity. I kept pretty calm during this whole thing and carefully thought my way out of it. Overall I feel pretty good about this all. I will now go sleep deeply and rest well and aspire to inspire my students tomorrow.","name":"6","updated":{"$date":"2014-12-25T04:44:37.645Z"}}

A black woman taking care of her little sister named Discovery on her own like as a single mother. I dreamed about biking through a game of crochet and getting hit by three balls on my way through and feeling really hurt because it seemed like the players aimed at me while I tried to get through unobtrusively.

We started out this day by getting up at 7:00 in the morning. We cleaned up the apartment a bunch and then went to Trader Joe's. We got back by 9:00 with a bunch of groceries which I carried on my back and by 10:00 we received our Amazon Now delivery. Good times! \n\n9:18:45 PM: Took a nap until 12 and then made lunch for Daria. I used the leftover kimchi soup we had, added some kale and egg to it and made rice. Then we went on a date to Harney and Sons we had a Parisian Black Tea there and the vanilla scones. After that I went to taijutsu. Today Andy, Justin, Anthony, James and Josh showed up. Josh showed us some new variations on muso-dori from shinden fudo ryu. Go into muso-dori bringing the front hand up the center line to make them flinch up. Lock the arm, then rotate into ganseki. New for kihon, practice with a rooting strike to start the movement, they have to react to the strike and get into kamae to start the movement. \n\n9:20:06 PM: A really successful night of luv making. I conserved my energy while giving Daria an amazing orgasm and we kept going afterwards for a while. Then I had her get on top and practice her sexercising for a while. Good times. \n\n9:30:57 PM: I think I will do a strength circuit now. \n\n9:33:40 PM: Time to update the good ole reading list. \n\n10:23:08 PM: Solid strength circuit just now. \n\n10:58:41 PM: Just upgraded all my socks to Datsusara hemp socks. \n\n11:44:40 PM: Solid banishing ritual and taijutsu practice today.

I got up earlier and played with Luke and Priscilla for a while. I bought Priscilla Sim City 4. Only ten dollars, pretty wild. We played some nidhogg and BS, which I won with my usual dirty methods. Then I went off the airport. I felt slightly stressed because it took my parents a while to come back from their walk and they took a while to get ready to drive me to the airport, but I ended up having more than enough time so it all worked out and I felt glad that I didn't display any stress. My bag got pulled aside for extra screening at the security line, but things went fine. On the flight I met a nice girl named Madi who works as a kindergarten teacher at a Jewish temple on the Upper East Side. I got through my block pretty early on and asked her name and introduced myself, then we had very pleasant conversation during the entire flight which made the flight feel very short. So a nice time. I found out she writes poetry and creative non-fiction so I gave her a link to my writing and invited her out to Mike's open mic. I haven't heard from her and don't know if I ever will, but I had a good time meeting her. I keep seeing echoes and reverberations of our meeting, I will feel so happy when the impact occurs.

Well, I have had a crazy couple of days, which I suppose I should record for the sake of posterity. \n\nOn Monday I had a taijutsu class that Harold, Mike, and Rob showed up to. We reviewed some of the same techniques that we went over on the Saturday before that. I still felt slightly under the effects of LSD when I went to that, leading to a very interesting class. At one point I felt enormous pressure inside my head and I tried to let the bujin come through me. \n\n4:07:30 PM: I think I will do a banishing ritual as I feel a bit uneasy today. I didn't get the chance to give Daria a proper send off because Calvin and Lindsay came over. They got here on Wednesday and Daria and I showed them around the city a while. We took them to bagels on the square for breakfast. We then went uptown intending to go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but we ended up getting off around 50th because we anticipated meeting up with Harper. We explored midtown, visiting the Cathedral of St. Patrick and also the Cathedral of St. Anthony. We went to the Rockefeller Center and saw the big tree and the ice rink. Then we made our way over to the top of the highline. We walked down to Chelsea Market where Daria and I ate Australian meat pies. Harper, his brother Graham, and his husband Joe all came along. We parted ways after Chelsea Market. Calvin and Lindsay came with Daria and I back home to change. I put on my suit for the first time in ages and Daria put on a black dress and we went over to Randall's apartment. When we got there only Steve, Randall, and Kelly had arrived, so we had a good time catching up and drinking champagne. \n\n4:21:12 PM: Good banishing ritual. Pretty average I would say, I tried using the taijutsu movements, I feel like the sign of the enterer works better so I will stick to that. It seems to work well for expelling energy.  \n\n4:47:30 PM: Good strength circuit. I also used the NLP deck to program myself to sleep on my back. I will give it a few days and see how I progress. I feel excited for GNK tomorrow. I will need to remember to bring Tenacity with me. \n\n5:06:38 PM: Tuesday morning I went to Ignacio's class and met Demetrios. Ignacio helped me a lot with san shin, I have a lot of points to work. I have to work on having less tension while doing it so I can keep my balance right. For ka and sui no kata I have to come back down the center with my attack. I have to stop tensing up my shoulders when I do those. I need to initiate my movements from my core not from my shoulder or head. I have to bring my guard hand up by the elbow not by the hand so that my hand and forearm can remain relaxed.

I will attempt to drift into astral project while lying on my back.\n\n8:07:23 AM: Dreamed I went to some sort of asian dinner big get together. In the bathroom I talked to some of the sons and daughters there about the achievements they accomplished while going to the bathroom and I learned about this Indian nerd contest or something. I remember my datsusara towel sitting on the floor drying up some water. I remember having to figure out what to get from the store for a party because one of the parents asked. The party took place in a huge grocery market that had multiple floors. Later I dreamed about this strange universe where we could grow artificially intelligent digital life forms and this complicated plot of AI life and my family all trying to destroy stuff and not destroy stuff. It didn't quite make sense in the end. It turned out it was just a TV show I was watching when my family showed up to the room. \n\n10:45:42 AM: Also dreamed of driving to this mountain top site to recover an archaeological artifact.  We came upon the archaeological or restoration crew and had to sort of fight them to find what we came for and then run off in a hurry. We don't know if we really found it or not. I had to login to my internet in order to start the car. I had to lock the people in a room and then get the car going to escape. All the siblings and I played Wesnoth. \n\n11:23:54 PM: Well, I suppose I should write about today. I practiced taijutsu and did my strength circuit for an hour, then I showered and walked down to Chinatown to visit Prosperity Dumpling, where the epic five borough limo dumpling tour began. I think we only visited three boroughs in total. We definitely went up to Flushing, we might have also visited Jackson Heights. I went in both the escalade and stretch hummer. I met a lot of people and networked with them all on Facebook. I really enjoyed hanging out with Monica and Wendy. Monica told me about her senior thesis asking what moral obligations a state has towards its illegal immigrants. She said that the state has to provide education and health care, she didn't include a minimum wage because first they need an education in order to get work. We also talked about the experience machine. I met Erica who told me about this cool yoga studio she goes to, she has done yoga for twelve years. She runs her own startup called Catchpool. I met a new Jesse who runs this service called loose leaf that does markdown publishing. \n\n11:27:25 PM: I did a bunch of work today. I set up a thing in glassfrog for kimberly, I met with the royaltyreminder team. I posted a lot more on the Densho and set up a new category to help with finding a new dojo location. I like seeing Josh so active on the dojo, pretty inspirational. Has definitely inspired me to step up my practice.

A lot of energy sensation. Seems like I hang more of a hang of the orbit now. Definitely need to practice this sitting up. Lying down just doesn't compare. I guess Dr. Morris got that part right and I should have listened to him all along, I could have gotten much further in my practice by now if I had just started doing it sitting up all the time.

The first limo, the stretch hummer had cheesy yellow and purple lights. The decor reminded me of 80s skating rinks. It had several coolers for the champagne and a lot of cup holders. Not especially comfortable seating since we still had to sit in a car.

It had a mechanical Balrog in the center that would move about and also a shiloth on the side.\n\n9:35:26 PM: Today something I dreamed about came true.

I will wake up tomorrow and do some awesome stuff like taijutsu and the KAP meditation in the morning.

I got fooled like that, and after going through a lot of trouble to infiltrate the country, riding on a janky train system, almost getting bashed to death by a psychotic robot arm/centrifuge system inside of a nuclear laboratory. I remember having to kill many people in creative and violent ways while very injured and pushed into desperate corners. In particular I remember getting cornered into a balcony and throwing knives as a distraction while I unbalanced and tipped people off the side. Eventually I got the guy, I thought, which the assistance of his top female aid who said something like \"The beginning of the Right's coup has occurred!\" while helping me kill the fake, and all his other people acted as bystanders while we encased his body in some kind of black plastic/plaster seal to in order to transport as proof of his death.

My concentration didn't feel as good as the previous time, but I still got strong effects. Shaking, shivers throughout my body, and sweating. I don't quite know if doing the orbit I should focus on moving the shivers up and down or just focus on the visualization of energy moving in the orbit. I don't know for sure if the shivers constitute the energy itself and I should learn how to control those, or if they just occur as a side effect of moving the energy which I do the visualization. I will have to investigate that. Maybe a good thing to ask Tao if I get the chance to. ","name":"1","updated":{"$date":"2015-01-06T12:02:20.614Z"}}

But we went over to the front of the house and we all saw it. It kind of drifted in the sky on big gusts of wind and didn't flap much. Then one of our cats or dogs brought over little clay statue that had faces all over it. I felt very happy to have received it.

Later after feeling frustrated and bored and trying to get away from the apartment after smoking DMT I decided that I would go ring her doorbell and see if she needed any help setting up her IKEA furniture. I helped her build a Malm bed and we made pretty quick work of it. I found her interesting and intelligent and beautiful. Interesting. I recalled a sigil I made the summer I moved to New York saying something like 'Daphne will ask me to have sex with her' and I thought perhaps I didn't specify enough and now it will happen. She says she wants to home school her children. I think I overheard a conversation with her father, who she addressed as 'sir'. Very interesting. I wonder if she might have mixed ancestry too. She mentioned coming from Shanghai when very young. She claims to know some Mandarin but wouldn't speak it with me, so I don't know how much she really knows. Claims to have done hacking at Raytheon as an intern. Has switched to learning management consulting at Stern. Set to graduate early. In her junior year right now. Works at a 3D printing company in PR. Mentioned that she would like to solve the problems in Sub-Sahara Africa and in American education. Likes to wear black.

I just have to build up my resources and suffer through the now, U know, until I have the circumstances I need to do my life’s work. I feel sure U understand.\n\n_No._\n\nWhat do U mean no?\n\n_Maybe I won’t let U._\n\nWhat?\n\n_U assume U will have time ‘eventually’. Maybe I’ll just end U right here.

I will always threaten U._\n\nPlease, have mercy on me.\n\n_Very well. Take this maxim to heart: the sooner U start, the more likely U will finish._\n\nReally though? If I start something I don't feel ready for, then maybe I won’t have the capacity to finish it.\n\n_FOOL! Have U learned nothing? Feel U not the awe? BOW BEFORE ME. U always have the capacity.

,{"_id":"Y3LPdbAc9zcc9gqeh","active":true,"url":"be_happy_for_no_reason","prose":"uYaoTJNKuzcSfnX9M","text":"Recently I've practiced the skill of feeling happy for no reason whatsoever. I wish I had learned this skill years ago. It would have saved me so much unhappiness. For some reason, I acted like a dunce and thought that I needed a reason to feel happy. This led to lots of pointless behaviors, like trying to do things in order to feel happy. What a bother, when I can just choose to feel happy whenever I want. \n\nThis whole idea that I need a reason to feel happy has really started to unravel. I rarely don't want to feel happy, which seems like good enough reason \nto feel happy to me. I used to think like such an ignoramus that I would think, “I feel unhappy now, but I will feel happy when I get into a top university.” What a load\nof hogwash. Instead I will think, “I feel happy right now!” \n\nI no longer find this skill particularly difficult. Learning [meditation](meditation) can certainly help make it easier to pick up, but U probably don't even need it. I’ll describe the\nway I developed this skill, and hopefully U can learn it too. I have a lot of trouble thinking of a skill that I find more useful than this. Most skills\nI learned with the eventual goal of becoming happy, but this cuts right to the core of the issue.\n\nA few days ago, I felt happy for several good reasons. Persephone had arrived, and as she made the weather a perfect balance between cool and warm with the sun and breeze playing off each other so delightfully. I sat in the fountain at Washington Square Park, listening to an amazingly talented drummer, Steven, channeling the muses through his simple drum kit. His two gifted friends accompanied him. They danced to\nhis playing and helped him collect donations from the crowd arrayed around the fountain. A bunch of little kids joined in the dancing and one of the dancers, Bobby, invited the audience to come up to dance. I figured if a little kid can do it, I would too, so I joined in. It felt great to let loose in front of the forty some spectators, without a care in the world. Afterwards, I made friends with Steven, Bobby, and Kristin. \n\nI felt fully present in the moment above. I consider that the important part of this story for developing the skill of feeling happy for no reason whatsoever. That meant I could really feel the happiness, and really notice all the details of the moment that accompanied that feeling. I find that important, because I find the brain acts as a big association machine. When I want to feel happy again, I just have to bring up the associations I’ve made with happiness. I just have to conjure up the crowd in the fountain, the bright noon sun against my skin, the scent of cherry blossoms, the ecstatic beat of the drums, and imagine myself fully situated in that memory. Then, as if by magic, I feel happy. \n\nNext time U feel really happy, pause for a moment and notice everything about that moment. Everything that U notice acts as a trigger that U can use later to bring that feeling back. The more U practice, the better U get. I didn’t think it possible, but I feel increasingly happy whenever I want. I hope U find this skill as liberating as I do. Everything I do feels more enjoyable when I do it happily.","name":"2","updated":{"$date":"2015-01-26T02:00:24.375Z"}}

I began the sleepless spell yesterday and so far I have gotten up right away in the morning. I notice myself yawning so I think it will take a few nights for my body to fully adjust to the new DNA and for my beliefs to shift, but it does seem like I can program myself to sleep less. I feel amazed to even have woken up in what seems like four hours after going to sleep. I will have to monitor this experiment closely and see how the day goes. I wonder what to do with breakfast and whether I can fill up my morning with enough activities that don't make noise to not wake Daria. Oh, cool though, I can totally start the day off with a KAP meditation in the time I've just bought and I expect that to yield huge synergies. Hm... wondering if I should head to Dev Bootcamp early in order to avoid waking up Daria and to give me the opportunity to banish some swathes of space there.\n\n5:32:25 AM: Good KAP meditation in terms of energy movement, didn't get much third eye activity this time despite seeing a lot of moving purple last night before bed. Interesting. But still, glad to have the time in the morning to start the day with KAP, feeling good about this. I think I would like to do my strength training now and then see about breakfast. I have some inspiration to work on RoyaltyReminder today so I think I will implement the administrator account. I will just go into the database to create it. I think I need to add a new field to the author model in order to accommodate the new permissions. Also I will replace the delete button for contracts with an 'archive' button that will move the contract to the archived section of the site, which I still need to build but I consider pretty easy to do. \n\n5:35:52 AM: Also, while doing the KAP meditation it brought back memories of times while a child when it seemed like I really didn't need as much sleep as people told me I did, like the time I stayed up all night playing in order to see the garbage truck come in the morning because I really wanted to know how the garbage would disappear. \n\n5:46:16 AM: Well, now I feel totally exhilarated because I just did my best headstand ever.

My morning routine got disrupted a tad because Daria slept in the main room because she stayed up late writing her lit hum essay. Not sure why she chose to do it all last night rather than in the morning, but her life decisions I guess. Maybe she just works better in the night. Apparently salsa threw up this morning.\n\n9:47:39 AM: I think I will go do my exercise for the morning.\n\n10:03:25 PM: Alright, got some things to write about before Daria gets home. Have to get it out now because I don't really trust that I can freely write my thoughts once she gets back. Today didn't feel too stressful for an assessment day, and I think I will have good results tomorrow. Anyway, I will have to see. I quite liked Naturalistic Occultism, I could certainly do with a dose of the common sense in there. Most of my problems don't really require magick, except that of finding Aliza, but that requires the kind of patient day by day magick that doesn't really seem flashy anyway. I should formulate my theories of magick soon and start operating off them. I have an idea of an energy construct, a servitor which harvests energy from the rotation of galaxies. It will connect to all my other constructs in order to power them. I would like to build a face visor that looks completely invisible but filters the information coming into me in a helpful manner, for instance making my vision sharper. It could also apply a glamor to my face so that people perceive me in a kinder light. I had a really good time meeting with Steve today. He came in to DBC in order to meet with Sharnee. He will come back next Thursday to speak at DBCx which I find pretty cool. Or maybe he will speak at Career Day, not sure which, but in either case, very cool. I think I should probably see if I can help Shar'nee out somehow, she could probably use some help. I can't help but have some feelings for Melissa because I find her awesome although I also want Zack to have happiness, but I don't know what to do there. Josh told me about the room in his apartment that I could move into if he manages to close on the contract. I feel a little worried about the cat situation if I wanted to move in there. I have started to realize just now that I really haven't typed very much recently, I feel like my hands actually have to get back into the rhythm of this. They feel a bit out of practice although I still seem to type pretty well and without many typos it seems. But I could certainly type faster, I don't remember it taking so long for me to get my thoughts out previously, but I also haven't written for quite a while. Anyway, so Josh would like me to pay him in cash, which I could probably do. I really need to check how much money I have in my TCF account. I REALLY need to call TCF and get my account reinstituted because I find it utterly ridiculous that I don't have access to my account. I should probably do that tomorrow. I will pack my checkbook with me so that I can call their customer service and have my account details ready. I really can't go much longer without knowing how much money I have. I got another shipment of MDMA today which I find pretty exciting. This batch looks pretty good too, but obviously I haven't tried it yet because when do I have time? I had a good time hanging out with Daniel Saewitz yesterday. It doesn't seem like he has much direction in life but he really wants to work with me. I don't know if I trust him enough to work with him. I would rather work with someone like Steve and Randall if Randall can ever escape the clutches of Kaplan. I wonder how long I will work at DBC for. I do love my work but I don't love my hours. I should find some ways to use my time at DBC more productively. I really need to create a seating and table situation that suits me there because I really hate using my laptop at work currently. I think moving in with Josh would work out really well. I seem like his top student right now if only because I show up for his classes the most. He doesn't seem to correct me on a lot of things that he corrects other people on. I hope that means that I've figured some of it out but I always check that the advice he tells other people doesn't apply to me. Or I should say, I always check myself using the advice he gives other students. I've found the focus on kicking lately really interesting. Oh yeah, so I really love Steve Dean, I find him highly awesome not only because he practices polyamory but also because he has such an extraverted and people oriented way of living and he seems very free. I had some very interesting conversations with him. He wants to publish a piece on the platinum rule, which says \"Do onto others as they have expressed they would like done unto them\" a much better of living.

As Robert Anton Wilson put it, \"Whatever the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves.\" \n\nI see a great opportunity in this. Knowing that we can come to believe anything, and continually confirm and empower those beliefs we will take great care in choosing some fundamentally positive beliefs and then rejoice in their application.\n\nEach belief that we choose becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.

Since our perception of the world takes place entirely subjectively, changing our perception has the effect of changing our own subjective reality. Belief becomes Perceptions which becomes Reality.

Good ideas do not necessarily require you to act immediately to bring them about. Positive innovation will require you to alter yourself and your basic habits before you will see much change in the world or your environment.\n\n### Mercury Quincunx (Inconjunct) Neptune\n\nLots of time and effort can be wasted when you plan on things that are way out of reach. Your imagination and ideals serve you well when you are careful to keep the sequence of essential happenings in mind and accept your own idiosyncrasies. Be careful you don't promise more to others than you can deliver. Self-honesty is not easy but it is essential in order to develop.\n\n### Venus Quincunx (Inconjunct) Uranus\n\nLearning to let go of the past means being willing to release relationships you have outgrown. Further, you need to reevaluate the way you imprison yourself in mindless routines, then revolt against them. Different is not improvement necessarily, yet change is integral to development. Learning to abruptly alter circumstances without emotional turmoil is the way of growth. You need freedom through relationships, not freedom from relationships.\n\n### Jupiter Quincunx (Inconjunct) Saturn\n\nYou easily overextend yourself, then wonder why others take advantage of you. Learning to see your real obligations without being talked into having an overblown picture of yourself is the way to success. You can get in a trap of believing that only you can do a certain task, thus you end up having to do it. At root you may find the same item in your personality that throws your self picture askew is that quality which causes you to develop a self-righteous attachment to your deeply held prejudices.\n\n## Resources\n\nhttp://www.constellationsofwords.com/\nhttp://skyscript.co.uk\n\n#### Moon in Taurus: Moona\n\n\"I will wait for U, take whatever U need.\" Attitude of passive nurturance, of feeding from the breasts (udder of cow). \n\n#### Jupiter in Virgo: Athena\n\nVirgin daughter of Zeus. \"Stable, steady, sturdy, solid, subtle, sustainable, strategic expansion.\"\n\n#### Saturn in Aquarius: Scythe\n\nFriendly avatar of Death, spurs us onwards.

The intellect is often highly pronounced, and many with this sign rising are gifted with an innate intuition- able to see the gestalt of a whole system in one moment, and make pinpoint decisions based upon multi-leveled dimensions of information. There is likely to be a pronounced tendency to act in ways that will benefit the collective, rather than provide personal gain. This then is the rising sign of the true humanitarian, who gets what they need in ways that are socially responsible and considerate.\"\n\n\"Yet you will find your greatest happiness comes about when you find the joy and love that is lying beneath most outbursts of emotion and intensity, learning to redirect this emotion toward the benefit of all. You may denigrate and look down upon others when they seek to be recognized and seen as important, for you have an innate dislike of self-centered behaviors, and a tendency to view emotional neediness as a curious weakness found in lesser beings. Opening up to the emotional and passionate dimensions of your being helps you to avoid too much aloofness, or cool objectivity, and lets you realize that in order to be truly human, you need to respond with both reason and emotion to life’s experiences.\"\n\n#### Saturn in 1st House\n\n \"You were born old, and had a difficult life and many responsibilities as a youngster. You will be given opportunities to experience your youth as you grow older, however, and to overcome feelings of not having been loved. And as you mature into yourself and your life you will be able to give yourself some of the freedom and parenting you lacked as a child.\"\n\n#### 2nd house Establishing (Taurus - Venus) - \n\n\"Capable of hard work, you need to build up your confidence and sense of self-worth. Be aware of selfishness if Saturn is also in Aries, Taurus, Cancer or Leo, and/or has hard aspects to personal planets. You've probably been shy and introverted, and are conservative when it comes to your personal appearance and communication with others. You are impartial and don't play favorites or get overly personal.\"\n\n#### Mercury in Leo\n\n\"THE steady glow of Leo has an altogether admirable effect on the shy, silvery Mercury. As “the adolescent” among the planets, the solar influence is just what he needs “to make a man of him.” In other language, it may be said that this position adds heart to brain; and brain without heart is the essence of all mischief\"\n\n\"Taking a comprehensive view, one may affirm that this is one of {203} the best possible positions of Mercury.\"\n\n#### Sun in Leo\n\n\"THE Sun in Leo is his greatest strength, for Leo is his own house and his influence is not even complicated by the exaltation of any other planet therein. We find here the most enormous vitality and strength of constitution.\"\n\n#### Moon in Taurus\n\n\"THE Moon in Taurus is in her exaltation; the sign tends to bring out the quiet and reflective side of the Moon and at the same time to steady her changeful nature. It is one of the best signs in which she can be found.\"\n\n#### Venus in Leo\n\n\"LEO is by far the noblest of the signs and brings out the best qualities of Venus. Venus in Leo is not so passionate as in Aries, but she is loyal and warm-hearted. She becomes capable even of that highest virtue of self-sacrifice without which all is in vain. She becomes that Charity of which the apostle Paul waxed eloquent. This however, depends as usual upon aspects; and attack of Saturn (for example) may undo all the good and transform it into evil; yet this is not so easily accomplished as when she is in a more passive and sensitive sign. However fallen, she always retains some memory of her ancient dignity.\"\n\n\"To return to the by-paths of history, we may cite the great-hearted and magnanimous Garibaldi, as illustrative of this position, while its nobility and good-feeling were also very clearly manifest in the character of Cardinal Richelieu. Curiously enough, his successor, Mazzarin, has the same position, but in Mazzarin, these qualities were by no means strongly marked. A glance at his nativity explains why Mercury is in conjunction with Venus, masking her warmth by his rational and calculating acumen, and she is {274} seriously afflicted by a square of Uranus on the one side, and of Saturn on the other. The position of Saturn, which dominates the horoscope from the Mid-heaven, emphasizes the selfishness of the native, and Uranus, being in bad aspect to Venus, hinders the emancipation and breadth which a friendly aspect might have restored to her. These aspects might not have been sufficient to destroy her influence, had not Saturn been so extremely powerful in the horoscope. Not only is he in the Mid-heaven, but Lord of the Ascendant. Saturn is, therefore, the key of the complex, and is sufficiently powerful to out-weigh the influence of Leo upon Venus.\"\n\n#### Mars in Taurus\n\nThe heaviness of Taurus weighs him down, and, though he fights with desperate courage, there is not that elan which we found him to possess in Aries. Nor is the Venusian character of the sign favorable to his full development; since, Taurus being earthy, it sometimes occurs that he is degraded to be cruel and callous. Yet, at his best, he is steady and earnest; not so original, brilliant, nor lucky as when in Aries, nor so confident of the issue; but dogged, and as the saying goes: \"Dogged does it.\" \n\n#### Jupiter in Virgo\n\n\nJUPITER IN VIRGO \nIN Virgo, Jupiter is again in detriment, as this sign tends to bring out his duller and more earthly qualities. We, therefore, shall not expect to find here much expansion or altruism or even strong religious feeling. Petrarch and Victor Hugo may immediately strike the casual observer as apparent exceptions to this rule, but the former has Jupiter wonderfully developed by sextiles of Neptune and Venus, and a semi-sextile of the Sun and Mercury on one side and Saturn on the other. The latter has Jupiter in the tenth house conjoined with Saturn, Semi-sextile to Uranus and in opposition to the Sun and Venus. In general, the native is very practical in his religious views, which are intellectual, even materialistic, rather than devotional or spiritual. A more typical example, therefore, is Paul Kruger whose Jupiter has Mars in conjunction, Neptune in trine, and Uranus not far off it, Venus only five degrees from exact conjunction, and Mercury semi-sextile. In this powerful complex, however, Mars, lord of the Ascendant, is the key, and Jupiter merely adds good fortune to Mars. Thus, while the religious and humanitarian nature was extremely strong, it remained strictly subservient to more important material forces. \n\nThe anarchist Vaillant had Saturn in conjunction with Jupiter, chilling him, and Neptune in opposition, rendering his movements eccentric; Mars is sextile, denoting activity; hence the strong-headedness and strong-handedness of his essentially humanitarian impulses. Lord Brougham, cold-blooded lawyer, also has Jupiter in {374} Virgo. The square of Uranus weakens the benignancy of Jupiter, while the sextile of Saturn constricts it into prudence; there is nothing to expand or fortify its benevolent impulses. The Jupiter of Bulwer-Lytton, on the other hand, has a sextile of Neptune, lending a mystical tendency, though not a very powerful or precise one, to the religious element, which is also made rather superficial by a square of Mercury. But Jupiter is strengthened by Saturn applying to a conjunction within twelve degrees; and, as Saturn is in the third house, his influences tinge the whole mind. \n\nAlbrect Durer, saturnine though the austerity of his mind declares him, has yet a deep reverence. Venus is trine to Jupiter, and Uranus semi-sextile, giving what might be called a good average development. The Virgo influence, however, leaves some coldness. Sir Humphrey Davy, with Neptune exactly in conjunction with Jupiter, Venus trine and Saturn sextile, is genuinely religious. Having taken laughing gas as an experiment, he came back from unconsciousness exclaiming \"The universe consists of nothing but ideas.\" The greatest saint in his highest trance could hardly have known much more. It is a striking example of a truly religious subconsciousness, in one whose conscious mind was preoccupied with the affairs of exact science. \n\nAlexander Dumas has Jupiter conjoined with Venus and Saturn, the Sun semi-sextile on one side, and Uranus on the other. From these influences comes the jovial raciness of his famous stories. In Guy de Maupassant, Jupiter rising, in conjunction with Venus and Mars and with no help from without, is completely obsessed by this pair of passionate planets; and so we regretfully observe this brilliant author the slave of passions which ultimately slew him. \n\n\"The materialistic qualities of Jupiter in Virgo tend to permeate the higher side of the mind in all directions, and the native is practical, analytical, and skeptical to the point of requiring proofs. Naturally, this position gives marked ability for scientific research, and generally for teaching and for service to others. It also, as in Taurus, gives great constructive power which may manifest itself in success in manufacturing, building, agriculture, or even in literature, according to the bent of the mentality. \"\n\n#### Saturn in Aquarius\n\n\"AQUARIUS is by far the best house which Saturn can occupy. The airiness of the sign lightens the heaviness of the planet, and therefore there is no such harshness as is given by the sign of the Goat. Aquarius, too, is par excellence the sign of Science; and it gives free scope to the wisdom-quality of Saturn in a way that no other sign {433} can do, while the humanitarian impulses of the sign tend to lessen the selfishness of the planet. Even when unoccupied by Saturn, his influence tends to make its natives comprehend the true significance of the ego, tempering the crude consciousness of the self with some understanding of its cosmic importance. \"\n\n#### URANUS IN CAPRICORN \n\n\"IN Capricorn, Saturn's constricting restraint directs the explosive force of Uranus, just as the binding walls of the cannon intensify the effect of the discharge. With Uranus in this sign we get \"an he-goat also, against whom there is no rising up.\" The native of this position is, in Kipling's phrase, \"a first-class fighting man.\" The examples of this quality are so convincing that they need only to be mentioned. The power evoked is so great that no afflictions to the personality appear to daunt it, unless they are extraordinarily evil. The Magical Will of the Man, his Mission in the World, is everything to him.\"\n\n#### Neptune in Capricorn\n\n\"Neptune, when in Capricorn, gives an almost clairvoyant materialism, a penetrating perception into matter that, in strong nativities or when well aspected, is nothing short of brilliance. \n\nThere is no position more capable of producing great scientific minds in the realms of chemistry, physics, medicine, surgery, mechanics and the other material sciences. The comprehensive thoroughness, the painstaking exactness, the patient depth to the will is almost Herculean in its power.\"\n\n#### From UnaInOmnia\n\nEssential dignity scores (Lilly's table) (shows strength):\nSun 1 Leo: +5 (in domicile) Moon 16 Taurus: +8 (in exaltation, triplicity and face) Mercury Rx 16 Leo: -5 (peregrine) Venus 12 Leo: -5 (peregrine) Mars 28 Taurus: -3 (terms, detriment) Jupiter 13 Virgo: -3 (terms, detriment) Saturn Rx 16 Aquarius: +5 (domicile)\nAccidental dignity scores (shows ability to act):\nSun 1 Leo: +4 Total Conjunct 7th house cusp: +4\nMoon 16 Taurus: -5 Total 3rd house: +1 Partile square with Saturn: -4 Waning: -2\nMercury Rx 16 Leo: -7 Total Retrograde: -5 7th house: +4 Partile opposition with Saturn: -4 Under the Sun's beams: -4 Occidental: +2\nVenus 12 Leo: +8 Total 7th house: +4 Under the Sun's beams: -4 Occidental: +2 Direct: +4 Swift in motion: +2\nMars 28 Taurus: +14 Total 3rd house: +1 Free from combustion and beams: +5 Oriental: +2 Direct: +4 Swift in motion: +2\nJupiter 13 Virgo: +11 Total 7th house: +4 Free from combustion and beams: +5 Occidental: -2 Direct: +4\nSaturn Rx 16 Aquarius: +7 Total Retrograde: -5 1st house: +5 Free from combustion and beams: +5 Oriental: +2\nCombined Dignity Scores:\nSun 1 Leo: +5 +4 = +9 Moon 16 Taurus: +8 -5 = +3 Mercury Rx 16 Leo: -5 -7 = -12 Venus 12 Leo: -5 +8 = +3 Mars 28 Taurus: -3 +14 = +11 Jupiter 13 Virgo: -3 +11 = +8 Saturn Rx 16 Aquarius: +5 +7 = +12\nAlmuten of the Figure (planet with greatest essential dignity): Luna Lord of the Geniture (planet with greatest essential and accidental dignity): Saturn Significator of Manners (vehicle through which temperament is expressed): Saturn\nTemperament Calculation:\nAscendant sign: +2 Sanguine Ascendant ruler: +1 Melancholic Ascendant ruler sign: +1 Sanguine Moon sign: +2 Melancholic Moon dispositor sign: +1 Choleric Moon phase: +1 Phlegmatic Season: +2 Choleric Ascendant almuten: +1 Melancholic\nSanguine +3; Melancholic +4; Choleric +3; Phlegmatic +1\n\nYour temperament is slightly Melancholic (earthy), with strong Sanguine (air) and Choleric (fire) influences as well. You have very little water influence in your chart - so little that you may wish to fortify your lifestyle to compensate for this lack and bring yourself into a more perfect balance. Your fire planets give you a hot, dry nature, and your earth planets give you a cold, dry nature: therefore there is an abundance of dryness. This can be balanced by drinking lots of filtered water, and eating moist fruits and vegetables with every meal; otherwise, rigidity of body and mind may result; the formation of stones; or hardening of the joints and arteries. Stretch every day, and make sure not to sit for long periods. Avoid processed foods, and eat virgin oils such as olive and coconut. If you can spend time near or on bodies of water, this will also help soothe your dry temperament.\n\nThe benefits of a melancholic temperament are introspection, patience, self-discipline, a retentive memory, and tenacity. You are able to stay with problems longer than others, eventually penetrating matters of great obscurity and difficulty. That which is intimidatingly dense to most other people is of the greatest interest to you, and you enjoy the challenge of prolonged work in solitude to open up that which others find perpetually obscure.\n\nThis goes well with the scholarly enthusiasm of your sanguine influences, making you a deep thinker upon abstract matters. Your fiery choleric side - all those planets in Leo! - gives you an aggressive will, and you enjoy conquering obstacles, albeit with the gradual subtlety of method that your earthy side endows. I think you'd make a fine alchemist, drawing out the hidden life enclosed within the stone or plant through the transformation of the works of fire. The Sun shines within all nature, locked within matter's prison of inertia and corruption. You, a man of the Sun, with Saturn conjunct the Ascendant, are working on a similar situation within yourself - your fire is hidden within a fortress of ice.\n\nThe painstaking work and repetitive method of alchemy would suit you I think, though more conventional science would also appeal. Your Saturn is very highly dignified, and its position in your natal grand cross dominates your chart, so your tendency to work in a context that seems to imprison you with worry, delay and responsibility is balanced by an inborn talent to succeed in matters where others would fear to even make an attempt. The more slowly, precisely and perfectly you labor, the more you excel at tasks that are dauntingly complex and accomplish what others cannot.\n\nYou have a wonderful grand Earth trine between an exalted Moon in Taurus, Jupiter in Virgo, and Neptune and Uranus in Capricorn. Many things come easily to you, especially anything involving practical and sensual skills. It may take time to get full confidence in some of these areas, but you have the natural talent and it will be worth it. These include: math, computer programming, cooking gourmet meals, fixing and building machines, and engineering. You'll make a lot of money with these skills once you feel competent - you're a perfectionist, but don't let self-doubt hold you back. If you feel disappointed with your first efforts, just keep working on it and never give up. You'll find that you have an intuition about practical matters that you can't quite explain. You don't know exactly how you sensed that a certain spice would go so well in a certain dish, or that a certain property or stock would appreciate so rapidly, but you do have an inner voice you can trust. Thanks to Jupiter's influence, sometimes you go overboard with the things you enjoy; in order to counter such luxurious tendencies (perhaps spending a lot of time playing strategy games), remember to set goals and stay focused on your objectives and the schedule or timetable you set. Neptune trine Moon gives you a rich imagination, and Uranus trine Moon gives you an attraction to futuristic and technical things. Sci-fi/fantasy may be enjoyable, and since you're so serious you would also research the historical basis for magical ideas.\n\nA grand trine is something easy that you've always had, and therefore take for granted. Some people with such a gift fail to exploit it fully, because they can coast if they choose. You, however, have an equally challenging configuration in your chart that kicks you in the butt and makes you reach to become your best self, so long as you don't get too intimidated to begin. Your greatest enemy is inertia. Once you begin a project you're unstoppably persevering, but it can be easy to get in a comfortable rut, and you should make sure you're always tackling another mountain.\n\nYou also have a very close by degree grand cross involving Saturn in his own house, Aquarius; Luna in Taurus; Mercury in Leo; and Pluto in Scorpio. This is perfect for a ceremonial magician. You've just been through a major transit over that cross, namely Saturn conjunct Mars in Scorpio, (with Venus in Leo square them, conjunct your Mercury, which sucks a bit less). Things are going to get better soon, but I bet you've been stressed out this month.\n\nLet's take this grand cross apart aspect by aspect. First we should note that it's in the fixed signs, and therefore tends to be a persistent condition rather than a series of crises. Second, let's put the modern planet Pluto off for last and look at the classical planets, all of whose aspects are exact by degree. So you have a t-square of Luna (the home, family, emotions and subconscious mind), Mercury (communicative, calculating and discursive mind), and Saturn (the lord of delay, work, authority, cause and effect, and consequences). Many people with these three planets in mutual aspect seem to be on the autism spectrum in my experience, is that true for you? It's likely that you feel held back emotionally and devote your energy to projects, possibly painting, writing or music, or something equally solitary and creative.\n\nIf we look at the houses involved, we see Luna in the 3rd house of siblings and transportation, Mercury in the 7th house of partners and open enemies, and Saturn in the 1st house of your own body and self-presentation. I get the idea that frustrations or duties involving brothers and sisters, running errands, dealing with correspondence, getting around town, physical health issues like breathing and vision, and possibly a problem your mom has (Parkinson's is very Saturnian for example, or a mental health issue) may keep you tied down with a sense that you can't go too far in case you're needed, or in case you need someone else. But at the same time you may feel rejected and unappreciated. I kind of picture you taking care of a whole family as if you were the parent even though you're young, or in some way being blamed, or at least stuck with the consequences of, a misfortune that befell them. You love your home and family very much, but you may feel tied to it too tightly also.\n\nYou may worry about planning out your life, in case things go wrong and you're stuck for decades dealing with a responsibility that you find exhausting. So you're risk-averse, maybe not by choice, but also yearn to be able to shine as an individual, as a Sun in Leo person. And you may end up attracting a person with a very strong personality who dominates you and tries to get you to handle all the difficult tasks in life for them while they bask in the limelight. It's good to be aware the possibility that you could let someone steal your Sun while making you do all the Saturn for both of you, and make sure it doesn't happen.\n\nThis is particularly the case with Saturn square Moon, where the experience of one's family can be simultaneously controlling and rejecting, leading to incredible strength and self-reliance but also a consciousness that things will never be simple. You have a very strong Moon otherwise, and are good at handling practical tasks; it's just that you may feel stuck with them, too. A famous Saturn square Moon person was Nelson Mandela, who spent many years in prison but changed the world; another was Dr. John Dee, famous scholar and magician who had the a t-square of Saturn, Mercury and Luna in fixed signs like you. Studying their lives, and the way they handled the adversity and opportunity that came their ways, can be very instructive. There is a negative side to Saturn square Moon of course - Jeffrey Dahmer had Saturn square Moon. It's crucial to introspect about this part of yourself, heal pain from frustration and rejection you may have experienced, and avoid too much isolation even when it's very tempting to withdraw. Saturn square Moon can lead to great wisdom and a saintly detachment from the world's illusions, because the subjective \"cave\" you're in seems so much darker to you than to others that you're highly motivated to penetrate the veil.\n\nSaturn-Moon is also very austere, and it can be tempted to deny your physical needs as an act of self-discipline or even self-punishment. You could have food sensitivities or allergies, maybe even to your favorite foods or the foods you grew up eating often. It's important to find out whether this is true, because things like that can sap your vitality without you realizing why. You may have been denied key pleasures or treated harshly at school as a child, and it's important to find out if you're still suffering psychologically from that, and to go back and re-parent the child self, giving him the nurturing and love he might have missed back then, and deprogramming negative thoughts and beliefs. So what I'm saying is, you might still be mean to yourself without realizing it because of a harsh environment during your childhood (even though there was probably money), and it's super important to make up for it by treating yourself with great love and respect now that the power is in your own hands. That includes nurturing yourself and not automically denying yourself things, or criticizing yourself due to internalized negative messages.\nOkay, next is Mercury retrograde square Saturn. This simply means you have a love of the obscure, antique, mysterious, and serious, and you put a lot of work into your craft. On the plus side, Venus is conjunct your Mercury, and if you feel blocked in one area things flow with lucid brilliance in another. Beautiful lyrics and poetry would be good for you; you should learn an instrument; you should take up an artform. It will change your life for the better. Saturn opposite Venus means you could be intimidated by the highly technical and virtuoso skill you'd like to achieve, but go for it anyway.\n\nSaturn opposite Venus and square your Moon could make relationships with women somewhat uncomfortable. Perhaps you like flambouyant Venus-in-Leo type women, but are too shy to approach them since they seem like goddesses. Putting some women on a pedestal but despising others could also be a thing. You might be judgmental of them, and you might feel they're judgmental of you. Not to worry. You're meant to be in a long-term relationship, and once you find the right person you'll be set for life. If you haven't met her yet, look for her at a place like ComicCon where cosplay is common, or Burning Man - someplace where introverts let their inner rock star out. Do you have any interest in illustrating occult graphic novels btw? That's the kind of thing I see you enjoying. Something good for you would be a mixture of art, science, literature and the paranormal.\n\nOkay, time to consider the role Pluto plays in your t-square. If Saturn is the darkness of a mine or cave, Pluto is the volatile heat and invisible power of the depths of a volcano. Have you ever seen Alphas, or Heroes? That's the kind of extreme ability Pluto is known for, albeit in a less physics-defying way for most people. Often something dark happens to a person that pulls the mask off of what people are pleased to call reality, and then that person knows what other people deny. I think that with Pluto square Saturn, you know how bad things really are under the pretense and social games people try to hide behind. You know how much trouble the world is in, how imperiled our future is; you don't hide in shallow diversions and pretend all that is happening somewhere else, to someone else. Pluto square Mercury and opposite Luna makes you a natural psychologist, specifically because you see beneath appearances to the hidden source of phenomena, including human motivation.\n\nOkay, to sum up, you're a structured and methodical thinker with a creative and artistic streak, and you have a lot of opposite, contrary tendencies to reconcile. You're both self-denying and luxurious, for example. You're reserved but filled with an inner passion. Feeling torn between conflicting tendencies can sometimes make you feel stuck. You might look for a glamorous, quicksilver person to inspire or lead you out of this rut. You need to take better care of yourself, and surround yourself with water to make up for its lack of emphasis in your nativity. This wateriness includes love and compassion!\n\nSo that's the Saturn-influenced part of your chart. Oh, I should mention people fear you because you notice their mistakes. It might be prudent not to actually point them out to coworkers, though, unless you work in quality control; their egos, once bruised, may turn them into enemies. People hate to feel stupid, so throw them a bone once in awhile and say something kind when you can see they're trying hard, even if you can tell their approach could use some adjustment. The more you can stay verbally positive, the better your results in life will be. That might sound cheesy but I have found it to be true. This is especially true while you're cooking and eating (the critical inner parent gets activated then, and you don't want that influence squashing your life). You don't have to lie, but see if you can put a positive spin on your observations. Or lie a little if you want - people love flattery and there's no harm in making them feel good.\n\nNow let's look at the masculine planets. You have an interesting situation, and out-of-sign trine between Mars in Taurus and Sun in Leo, both given power by their conjunctions to angles. Usually Taurus and Leo are at odds, Taurus seeing Leo as all flash and no substance, where Leo sees Taurus as all physicality and no spirituality. Luckily, these two signs are working in harmony in this case, giving you the potentially ability to both charm and bulldoze your way to your objectivies. Though Mars in Taurus seems very calm, the Bull is intimidating, and people may be impressed by the restrained force they sense in you. Some will take it as a challenge eeven when you're not starting anything, and you may find yourself in the middle of a pissing contest without knowing how you got there.\nYour Mars is opposite Pluto, giving it extra power from the subterranean depths. You may be content to stay still and placid for awhile, but eventually something from deep within you erupts, sometimes to devastating effect. Nevertheless your burn is a slow and steady burn, and some may think you're indolent when really you're just biding your time. Mars in Taurus is also very sexy in that earthy physical way that loves to possess what he desires. You like a lover you can count on, someone who always wants you and who loves both your body and their own. Head games are not going to work on you. As far as you're concerned, if they don't know what they want then they don't deserve you.\nMars trine your Sun gives your chart a nice balance since Saturn aspects so many of your planets. In effect, you more feminine planets, Luna and Venus, are tied down by restrictive Saturn energy, while your masculine Sun is given the focus and drive of Mars. This is another way you may feel as though you have a contradictory nature: one part of you somewhat conservative and withdrawn, another part filled with a zest for life and a visionary sense of the good and true that scorns the limits of the practical and safe and wishes to lead others into a brighter future. I would say, let each part of you have its turn expressing itself and honor it on its own terms, because all have something valid to offer in the right context.\n\n#### 6th Month Forecast\n\nFirst of all, I thought I'd give you a list of fixed stars conjunct your natal positions. These can often be \"oddly specific\" and I thought you might find it interesting. For a more in-depth look at their meanings I included a link to a nicely-written web page, as each constellation also has its own lore.\nRising: Bos. \"Keen intellect, good for business, military, analysis.\" More here: http://www.constellationsofwords.com/stars/Bos.html\nYed Prior is conjunct the Midheaven. \"Success in astrology \u0026 9th house matters (these are religion, law, higher education, travel), shrewd.\" More here: http://www.constellationsofwords.com/stars/YedPrior.html\nConjunct Mercury: Dubhe (The Bear). \"Astrology, arrogance, psychic power, destruction; aka Krathu, one of the 7 Rishis (Hindu sages) in Ursa Major; Bast Isis, the Egyptian goddess; 'The Eye'; 'Heaven's Pivot'.\" More here: http://www.constellationsofwords.com/stars/Dubhe.html\nConjunct Venus: Acubens. \"Astrology, writing, perseverance, domestic problems, poison, liars.\" More here: http://www.constellationsofwords.com/stars/Acubens.html\nMars is somewhat widely conjunct Caput Algol, but this is such a major star that it should be taken into account. \"Primitive female sexuality; strangulation, beheading, danger to throat and neck, murder, violence, mass catastrophe; the 'Evil One', the Demon Star; passionate; intense; hysterical. Also associated with extreme creativity, an expression of the Dark Side.\" This is a fascinating star associated with mass uprisings and mob violence, such as during the Reign of Terror in France. As an eclipsing binary, it gives the impression of winking malevolently. In ancient times the \"dome\" of fixed stars, as the highest heaven, was considered immutable and perfect; so when there were changes, such as comets or variablity in star brightness, it was almost always considered ill-omened. This position is about to be activated by transits of Saturn and Jupiter soon, and so I wanted to introduce the topic of fixed stars before I got into your forecast. More here: http://www.constellationsofwords.com/stars/Algol.html\nJupiter is conjunct Coxa. \"Good for voyages, gain by merchandise, redemption of captives; prophetic ability (with Zosma: 'Kua, the Oracle'); strength; wisdom. More here: http://www.constellationsofwords.com/stars/Coxa.html\nSaturn is conjunct Alnair. \"Retiring, active, proud, watchful, kind, idealistic, devoted, liking for astronomy, 'the Bright One'.\" More here: http://www.constellationsofwords.com/stars/Alnair.html\nThe fixed stars are not as overt in their influence as planetary positions by sign, house and aspect, but over the course of a lifetime their themes can be seen woven into the life story in sometimes startlingly appropriate ways.\n\nThe next two lunations active your Sun and Moon, so you may find yourself with a lot on your plate this month. The New Moon this Thursday is a partial solar elipse at 0Scorpio15, and it is closely square your natal Sun. This eclipse is in a tight conjunction with Venus, and its theme is the journey of the goddess Inanna or Ishtar to the Underworld, where she dies for three days and is reborn. It takes place in your 8th house of death and debt.\nI always tell people not to get overly-creeped-out by eclipses hitting their natal positions: they are powerful, but they can take up to a year to unfold their influence, and though it can be a shock akin to a plant being dug up and replanted, the change is often a new opportunity that in retrospect will be obvious as a much-needed stimulus for growth. They save us from stagnation. Sol and Luna are the only \"planets\" that never go retrograde, and their conjunctions with the Moon's Nodes are like interruptions in their perpetual forward motion through the zodiac, giving us a chance to hop out of ruts. In fact, Luna physically wobbles in her orbit due to gravitational stress at these times. This influence is challenging because we're thrown out of our comfortable routines by a major new undertaking, but not necessarily destructive.\nIn your case, since your natal Sun is conjunct the Descendant, you are most likely to feel the strain in your relationships, especially concerning joint resources, borrowed money, or anything shared. You may also consider to what extent your identity and self-expression have been defined and conditioned by partnerships of various kinds. There will be a desire to strike out on your own and be your own person, but resource entanglements could make you feel ensnared; or if you have been independent up until now, you may get an offer to pool resources in some way. In that case - if someone wants you to invest in a business with them, or move in together - you might want to be extra careful. The hidden strings could turn out to be expensive. On the other hand, your impulse to be creative might make a collaboration on a project quite attractive, as a partner could ignite your inspiration. Be careful that it's clear who owns what, though.\nThe nature of the current change will be more obvious (the New Moon is just the seed of events, which flower over the next year in the case of a solar eclipse) during the next Full Moon on November 6. It takes place at 14Taurus26, closely conjunct your natal Moon and square your natal Saturn, Mercury and Venus. Tensions about money, roommates, siblings and transportation are likely to be high. You get more clarity about what your emotional needs really are, and the extent to which you may have been depriving yourself or letting other people impinge on them. This is a great time to pay attention to your dreams, and other ways by which your subconscious mind is trying to make its feelings known. This is a particularly rich time for writing. It's a way to get in touch with things you're thinking and want to say that are otherwise habitually inhibited. Don't be surprised if people start relying on you to give them rides or fix things for them, or if other odd little errands keep cropping up such as lots of email correspondence and trips about town.\nThis Full Moon is also closely trine your natal Jupiter, which is a really great aspect, putting you in touch with wise people and creating a sense of enthusiasm and expansion in your life. Major purchases are favored, as is a boost in your reputation at work. The Full Moon is trine your Neptune and Uranus, which amplifies your imagination and visionary abilities. This should be a really productive time for you in terms of being able to visualize the future you want and then taking practical steps to make it happen. It's a strange and interesting magnification of the natal pivot your Moon makes as both a point in your Earth Grand Trine and Fixed Grand Cross, where you're both unusually burdened and unusually blessed.\n\nNow for some transits I consider key. Saturn and Jupiter are two relatively slow-moving planets, and so they have a lot to do with the overall unfolding of your life and its phases. Currently they are in a tense aspect with one another, and the way this interacts with your natal chart is interesting.\nFirst some general notes on Saturn. Saturn makes a hard aspect to his natal position approximately every seven years, culminating with a return to his natal position at about age 29 (though you'll feel it for at least a year, most likely two). Saturn return is a famous milestone, considered the age of astrological adulthood, when the brain has finished its neurological development, particularly in the area of the prefrontal cortex - the area of planning and judgment, whose proper development are among Saturn's many gifts. People with a favorable natal Saturn, such as you have, are particularly well-endowed in the executive areas of mental ability such as reasoning, problem-solving, foresight, self-control, and assessment and regulation of appropriate social behaviors.\nBasically, the older we get the better we are at calculating the long-term consequences of our choices and formulating effective life strategies. We become more self-sufficient because of this, looking less to others for direction, and are more likely to be given responsibilies and trusted with power. We can control our external reactions to our emotions and do not act as spontaneously.\nOur progress in this area occurs in seven-year developmental increments. At age seven we are more independent from our mothers and define ourselves more by our school environment than our home environment, and are able to learn abstract concepts; at age fourteen we form distinct social groups, and learn and enforce social norms within them often different from those of adult society, thus defining ourselves by our peer group; at age twenty-one we are economically self-sufficient and often have our own families and careers, often defining ourselves by our jobs and spouse or academic trajectory. At age twenty-eight we receive the full consequences of our choices up to this point, and the structures we have built in our live are strongly tested by adversity to see whether they can hold up permanently. If not, we start over in those areas.\nPeople with a strong Saturn are more precocious in some of these neurological areas, which can paradoxically be somewhat isolating during teen years when foresight, self-control, ability to solve complex problems, ambition and a highly-regulated affect are considered nerdy and uncool. But guess who's laughing last, when the Saturn people run things after everyone's grown up. Such people often begin to feel vindicated at the age of twenty-one, when we gain a lot of freedom and the burdens we've labored under in our youth start to pay off in rewards. If we were conscientious and dutiful, it's finally paying off.\nAge twenty-one is the second Saturn square to its natal position, and you've just been through yours. It's also the year that Uranus is square its natal position, which makes us feel liberated from parents and social institutions that had kept our will in check. It's an exciting time, when people not only feel competent and able to handle their business, but also can individuate from family and social influences that might have kept them in an inaccurate pigeon-hole. We get to express more of what's really inside of us, and we're less afraid of responsibility.\nUranus and Saturn are very different from each other however, and sometimes people find the contradiction too much. Should they follow the Uranian urge to break out of their mold, and go packpacking around Europe? Should they follow the Saturn urge to invest in long-terms payoffs and go to grad school? There are lots of big choices here, and it can seem hard to know whether to take a big risk and gamble what we've gained so far or to dig oneself more deeply into a successful trajectory.\nThis is also a time when the Uranus influence pulls back the curtain from reality somewhat, and we realize that there is much more in heaven and earth than they people we grew up with ever talked about. Some people get carried away when they see behind the veil, and foresake Saturn's restrictions completely in a possibly misguided urge to try to fly. We get some of the best insights we'll ever have in our lives at this time. We're the most creatively fertile, and we have wisdom beyond our years. Some writers and mathematicians have career-defining breakthourghs at this time. But it's good to bear in mind that this rocket-boost is temporary, and to make a sound plan for what we're going to do with our visions when we finally have to land.\nTo add to the complexity of what you're currently undergoing, transiting Uranus is also trine your Venus and Mercury, and square your natal Neptune. This is really fantastic, especially for artists and creative people. And on top of that, transiting Jupiter in Leo is also conjunct your Venus and Mercury, opposite your Saturn and square your Moon. This is, as they say, epic.\nI feel like you're meeting a ton of new people right now, and they're just amazing. This has been a really good time for love, friendship, running into people you love to talk to, and having a lot of options in terms of not just people to socialize with but styles of relating. You might realize there are modes of sex and romance that hadn't been part of your life before, and do things that are quite experimental. Part of you may find the situation risky, and even ethically dubious because it's non-mainstream, but there's so much positive energy there that you also feel like you're finding out who you really are, and that's compelling enough to go for it.\nYour natal chart has a lot of significant others in it (shown by a packed seventh house), and I wonder if monogamy is really for you. Moon in Taurus square Saturn is pretty possessive and traditional, but Sol, Mercury and Venus in Leo in the 7th is all about passion and variety. Polyamory and BDSM (Saturn opposite Venus) could be options here. At any rate, whatever it is your heart truly yearns for is probably more obvious than ever right now, and you may well spend the next year expanding your social horizons and experimenting with alternative lifestyles. Just try to get enough sleep. :) If multiple romances are too much, you'll probably still find yourself hanging with a fantastically interesting and adventurous crowd of people who defy convention in these ways. If Jupiter is the giver of bounty I think he is, you'll probably find yourself embroiled in love triangles and e-relationships next year, maybe even meeting one of the loves of your life in April (when Jupiter stations conjunct your Venus). Try not to let your popularity go to your head. :) I wouldn't be surprised if you got married and had kids, as Mercury is ruler of your 5th house of children - if you haven't already, given that this August's Jupiter-Venus conjunction was in your 7th house, conjunct your Mercury! Nice. Lucky guy. With Saturn so active it probably felt like you had to work hard too, but wow.\nIn addition to people everywhere - and if that involves you being on stage in front of an audience, I think that would be particularly good - you will also continue to learn lots of new skills, and amass a great deal of information and/or produce a lot of writing in the coming year, thanks to Jupiter conjunct your Mercury. Are you thinking of buying a house? Mercury is also lord of your 4th house, which indicates property. If not yet, than look into that over the next six months and see if it's feasible. Hmm, maybe the 8th-house emphasis I saw with that eclipse could be a home loan.\n\nSo far we've covered Saturn bringing you into the next phase of responsible, self-sufficient adulthood and a greater readiness to handle serious commitments; Uranus showing your unique spark of genius and individuality, your self apart from all training, heritage and the cultural norms that may have conditioned your consciousness before, and the resultant desire to try new things; and Jupiter bringing you lots of social contacts, popularity and creativity, and giving you plenty of options to contemplate. That's the big picture: these long-term influences will persist into 2015.\nNow I'm going to start diving into some details, which will involve taking a look at some of the faster-moving planets, as well as Saturn's next influence as he moves away from his square with himself. I'll also take a look at your secondary progressions.\nIn fact maybe this is a good time to talk about Saturn opposing your Mars in Taurus in mid-December, an aspect that will repeat in 2015 as he retrogrades to station there for all of July and August. This is intensified by the opposition of Saturn to Algol. So this is the harsh news, basically. Saturn is going to conjunct your Midheaven, which describes your career and reputation, this Winter and next Spring. This is a huge test, and what you do now will affect your life for a long time. Luckily, when Saturn conjoins your Midheaven he also trines your Sun, giving you steadiness of purpose and the ability to conserve your vitality to survive this marathon.\nYour natal Mars is conjunct your 4th house cusp, and again I'm thinking that where you live is going to be a major situation. You have Gemini on the 4th (Mars is late in Taurus, your 4th cusp is early in Gemini), which can indicate two residences or traveling a lot for work. Mars in Taurus would be happier owning property in the country I would think - a nice house you can work on, with a place to grow things - whereas Gemini prefers the culture and stimulation of the city.\nI'm wondering if what's going on is a long-distance relationship, where sometimes you're at their residence and sometimes your own, and whether this isn't going to become a source of stress, perhaps feeling the need to commit to one or the other. Or you feel like you're on the road all the time, going from one place to the other. At any rate, whatever's going on with your living situation is going to become more and more of a pain; it may end up being under construction, or be a major expense, or if you live with other people there may be a fight, especially in December. Start thinking about what situation you ultimately want to end up in, and how you can afford it. The worst-case scenario is a fire or an accident, so make sure all hazards are cleaned up and you have a solid plan for emergencies. I only say this because Mars is volatile, Saturn's in violent Scorpio, and Algol is nearby - better too paranoid than caught with your pants down.\nThe best meaning this could have is that you're buying land and building a house on it according to your own design. It would satisfy the transits, and you'd have exactly what you really want. Or maybe it could be a space for a business that you'd be acquiring; that would also work with Saturn at the top of the chart. I could totally see you living upstairs from a dojo, for instance.\nOkay, now Saturn conjunct Midheaven. This is a sort of \"cosmic performance review.\" Depending on how you've been handling your life, it can either be a raise and promotion, or a fall and disgrace. Be ready to have your competence questioned and tested. Of course, if you're graduating college it's as simple as that. It's also possible that you will start teaching what you've mastered, since Mars rules your 9th house. You might have international dealings since the 9th house has to do with foreign countries.\nNo matter what happens, you'll be using your willpower to your maximum extent at the end of the year. It's important to compensate by eating more nutritiously, and stretching and exercising gently to avoid illness and injury. Be especially careful with your neck. If you take a lot of falls, you might want to be more conservative in December. (I'm a skier and I do potentially take a lot of falls, so I drill on perfecting my form and hold off on speed and jumps during Saturn transits.) You want to deliberately relax and release your stress and anger every day so it doesn't come out sideways as an accident.\nAlgol is a star associated with malefic magic, but the cool thing is that there's a protective talisman you can make using that star. I made one and I like it a lot. Here's an example: http://www.renaissanceastrology.com/silveralgoltalisman.html I didn't buy one from him, I got a Medusa pendant and engraved the back.\n\nWhew, that's all the bad news. :) This may all work out rather well for you I think, it's just not going to be a cakewalk.\nNow let's look at swift-moving Mars. He only spends a month or two in sign unless he stations, whereas Jupiter spends a year in a sign, and Saturn spends two-and-a-half years in a sign. Mars will spend November in Capricorn, which will be excellent mid-month as he joins your Grand Trine, giving you lots of energy and focus. Capricorn is in your 12th house of dreams, meditation and solitude; you'll get a lot out of focusing on work that you can do alone, and on introspective pursuits, especially November 12-20. If you do visionary work it will be particularly enlightening around then, I would think. If not, take note of your dreams and see what your subconscious is saying. Mars trine your natal Mars December 2 and 3 is great for athletic pursuits, general ass-kicking, and goal accomplishment.\nMars enters Aquarius in December, where it will cross your Ascendant. Is your birth time extremely accurate? If so, the days Mars crosses your Ascendant are December 11 and 12. Mars opposes your Sun first though, on December 6 and 7. This is a briskly agressive influence, and you will feel extra-energetic and ready to tackly intellectual problems. Other people may find you more confrontational. Mars opposite Sun can have to do with conflicts with authority figures or people who consider themselves leaders; you may refuse to take direction and end up with a pushy type of person in your face who takes it as a challenge. It's not really a big deal, but you might drive more conservatively to compensate for a streak of impatience.\nMars is opposite your Venus on the solstice. This can either have to do with sex or arguing with a significant other or both.\nMars conjoins your natal Saturn on Christmas. You chafe under responsibilities, want to do your own thing, stop yourself to some extent, and the inner conflict could give you a headache. Mars is also square your Moon and opposite your Mercury, so arguments with female relatives and your siblings looks probable. They'll want you take a responsibility that you feel they can handle themselves while also talking down to you like you're still a kid, I think. This only lasts a couple of days, it's just kind of annoying to feel discouraged by people who are supposed to be on your side. If it really gets to you, you might feel physically ill.\nMars squares your natal Mars on January 9 and 10. It's a high-energy day that could involve challenges and conflicts, especially with men, possibly over politics, religion or culture.\nMars enters Pisces mid-January, which makes nothing but supportive aspects to your natal chart. You'll feel pleasantly decisive while flexible about your approach, and people will mostly go along with your plans. You take on a decided leadership role when Mars in Aries trines your natal Sun on February 21. At this point, aggressive concern about finances will occupy you the next month and a half as Mars transits your 2nd house or resources. This is good for making money, particularly since Mars will trine your Leo planets and then trine your Jupiter during this time.\nIn late April, Mars in Taurus conjoins your Moon while it squares your Venus, Mercury and Saturn. You will feel very inflexible regarding your needs and opinions and others may find you autocratic, where from your perspective you've simply ceased to suffer fools gladly. This takes us to your Mars Return in early May, when your tasks regarding property, career and possibly travel become particularly urgent.\n\nI've been contemplating your secondary progressed chart. This technique involves counting forward in the ephemeris one day for every year of your life. So the chart cast for a week after you were born describes your situation at age 7; the chart cast for three weeks after you were born describes your situation at age 21. Some of this technique relies on having gotten an accurate birth time; other factors are slower-moving, and will still work if your birthtime is within an hour.\nFor example, I see p. Moon in Pisces exactly conjunct your p. Ascendant right now, but if your birthtime is off a bit this event could change by years. Assuming that we've got good data, what this means is that you are much more sensitive, psychic and compassionate than usual this year. You have a strong fantasy life, and are moved by stories and music much more. It's harder for you to maintain your boundaries, and sometimes you can feel other people's emotions and pain as though they are your own, which makes you both want to help them and avoid them since it's so draining. But the good news here is that this intensely watery combination balances out the dryness of your natal chart, so with that in mind it's a tremendous opportunity to adjust things within you that had long been stuck.\nWater is very healing, because it dissolves old traumas and scars, leaving you renewed. It's power of lubrication, nourishment and dissolution of waste from the past cannot be overrated: without it we would shrivel up, become immobile, and finally turn to dust. Water also allows you to feel your connection with the world around you in a compassionate and intuitive way. Your progressed Ascendant will be in Pisces for many more years, which is great. Your progressed Moon will be there for one more year and then it will move to fiery Aries. This is an opportunity to explore a side of reality that may not have been nearly so accessible before. For example, talents like scrying are something you could learn now. You also have a natural cloaking device (think the color-changing ability of an octopus) right now and can blend in to the background if you need to avoid something.\nYou might find that you've become so uncharacteristically flexible that you sometimes feel taken advantage of. This would have come to the fore in particular a month ago, when your p. Moon was square p. Mars in Gemini. It's the same theme of having to take care of someone, probably a guy, who's capable of being pretty immature and dishonest, though clever. This person is in your immediate environment: a neighbor, sibling or roommate.\nFour months ago something much sweeter happened, when p. Moon was opposite p. Venus. You met a woman who is sharp-minded, competent and skeptical.\nRight now your progressed Moon is sextile Uranus, which intensifies your interest in science, technology, and fringe topics like astrology. It helps you see reality from an abstract perspective, and that calls into question a lot of \"truths\" that conventional reality considers necessary to accept in order to be sane. As your p. Moon sextiles Neptune in two months, you'll get even more out there, wondering whether the astral sea is really populated by a spirit world and if so what their roles in our lives is; things like that. Neptune is a pretty ungrounded influence, so try to retain a functioning bullshit detector at all times.\nIn four months your p. Moon opposes Jupiter, which can be both good and not so good. On the one hand, you will be motivated by ethical ideals and generosity. On the other, it's tempting to overspend and overindulge. In two years progressed Jupiter will be conjunct your Descendant, which will be a prosperous time during which you'll run into teachers, religious people, wealthy people and wise people, and you will give a lot of thought to the higher purpose of existence; four months from now is a foretaste of that long-term trend.\nI see your p. part of fortune is conjunct your p. Sun, a great help for finances, especially with that Sun in golden Leo. I get the overall impression that you're doing very well in life, and other people are jealous and sometimes try to screw with you.","name":"15","updated":{"$date":"2015-03-25T16:06:47.577Z"}}

But I had a lot of fun yesterday going with Drew to the Go meetup and meeting some new friends. I had an intuition that they smoked weed in the basement so I took an opportunity to engage with Neal and got invited to the basement, I got really high off a single toke of the oil they smoked from a glass vapor genie. Good times. Had a nice relaxing evening at home afterwards, I slept very well on Drew's couch. Had a decent dinner of pizza yesterday. Today I want to do my bodyweight exercise (see how I can make do without a pullup bar, which I feel need to figure out by Iceland), practice some taijutsu (at least san shin) and clean up Drew's apartment for him a tad, especially doing the dishes since it seems he doesn't necessarily enjoy it and wants to put it off, so I will do him a favor to return his generous hospitality. I wonder how much Uber costs around here, he seems pretty unafraid of using it. \n\nLet's get all that done by noon so we have time to think and plan out the rest of the day, including anyone else we might want to visit in Boston.

I really love Daria, truly. I do not wish to hurt, and I wish to cherish her. Yet I love other people. I don't know what to do about it other than to keep loving, not to let people down as Richard Branson said. Anyway, time for some bodyweight exercise.

I kept feeling judgmental towards one of them in particular because she really had a lot of trouble concentrating on her book because she kept getting distracted by her cellphone.

On my way home. I have a lot of traveling ahead of me. I think about nine hours total of sitting in airplanes and buses. Actually, maybe more than that. I will get home around midnight, I hope. I have a lot of setup work to do for DBC still, hopefully Steven Harms replies to my email soon so I can get on that. \n\n2:19:52 PM: Okay, well, I have decided to just go ahead and fork the Eastern Moose's last phase 2, since I feel comfortable teaching that. I feel pretty on top of things, seems like if I can get into a comfortable habit of using Treedo my productivity will skyrocket from not having to process my priorities too much. It has a built in priority stack like Steve Dean mentioned. I find Steve Dean a very inspirational fellow, like I luv how he manages to live in New York City without paying rent, and how he handles polyamorous relationships. I have a lot of unprocessed thoughts from this trip that I think I should like to get down. I want to fix the margins on my website because right now they feel super wasteful. I don't like it anymore.\n\n2:32:14 PM: Okay, cool, this looks better. Maybe a little wide now, so I might change it back to something else. Lemme play with it. Well, in any case. I have certainly had a great journey and a really interesting time meeting everyone and seeing the sights in Iceland. I think the people who have made the biggest impact on me include Ocean and Finn. Ocean I found really fascinating. One of the first people I've met with mystical interests yet remaining firmly in the world. She just seems so amazingly multitalented. She showed me the power of astrology by doing about nine different chart readings and really showing a lot of insight into people she had just met. She taught me some basic acroyoga or acrobatics which I found really neat. She just has such an interesting life story, the fact that she has traveled so far and wide across the world at the age of eighteen just really blows me away. She gave me some good relationship advice. I certainly need to change my relationship with Daria because I feel unhappy about our relationship and I need to express that honestly. \n\n4:15:18 PM: I learned quite a bit about Ocean for the days. I even read her chart, which I have in my astro.com account, handily. So I found her story pretty amazing. Her mother had her at age 21 after a sexual assault. For the first five years of her life Ocean lived in New Zealand with her mother. Her mother ended up getting filmed in Lord of the Rings and in Xena: Warrior Princess. Pretty funny. Then they moved to Houston where her mom worked as a news reporter. After a while her mom started getting assignments out in South America as a conflict journalist, and she would bring Ocean with her and leave Ocean with various shamans and medicine men to take care of. Thus she ended up learning herbology from living traditions. Very cool. I would like to learn some of that from her. Ocean also trained in a French circus where she learned acrobatics. She also lived in India for a while working as a birthing assistant and learned acupuncture as part of the clinic. She assisted a lot of water births. Lately she has started a magazine called Real for youth culture. Her mother owns several large magazines including a big yoga magazine. Apparently her mother doesn't have time any more to actually do yoga though. \n\n4:15:24 PM: I would have to say this trip changed my life quite a bit. Even though I don't consider Ocean as Aliza exactly, she got very damn close in a lot of ways and it gives me a lot of hope. The spell seems to keep manifesting closer and closer results. A few syncs: Ocean has bronze red hair, she studied martial arts for a few years although I have difficulty considering what she studied a very real art it sounds like she has picked up a smattering of techniques. She shared a story about escaping a trap for foreigners disguised as a sarong shop. She had gone with three of her friends who worked in the ashram, and they behaved generally like naive foreigners. Ocean felt on guard. When they went into the \"store\" the door closed behind them. Inside a group of men started wrapping them up with sarongs and seemed intent on sexually assaulting all of them. Ocean used a \"grab, twist, pull\" technique she learned in order to tear a man's testicles off and then they escaped. Honestly, I don't really believe that story. She kept calling her teacher a \"dojo\" which strikes me as suspicious. I don't know her motives for telling that story or talking about having martial arts experience. Maybe to impress me? But it sort of had the opposite effect. \n\n4:19:49 PM: It just strikes me as crazy that she still attends online high school but has already started building a nation wide business with a readership of 250k+. Very cool. Her mom sounded very intense based on the phone conversations that I overheard. She has a god mother that works as an astrologer for several celebrities including Madonna, and Sting. So she learned astrology through her. She seems to have a pretty good read on people based on their charts. I would have to say she has a well developed intuition. \n\n4:25:27 PM: Anyway, very grateful to have met her because she certainly opened up my world a lot. And I might not have had a great night in Iceland the first day if I hadn't met her in the airport in Boston. Since I left my credit card at Drew's apartment I had a healthy amount of anxiety going into the aiport about how I would stretch the resources I had while in Iceland for a day. But I ended up getting to stay in her Airbnb with her, hanging out for a day with her and Finn and having a great time overall. We really bonded with a cat at the Airbnb named Timmy that ended up sleeping on the bed with us the whole night. Very cute. He meowed at us through the window. We stayed in a room in the basement of the house. Then we went outside and found him and let him in with us and then he pretty much hung out with us whenever we stayed around.\n\n4:32:35 PM: Ocean makes some great oatmeal and made a delicious brussel sprout stirfry too. She taught me that to bring out the wasabi flavor in brussel sprouts I have to add some honey or agave because the sweetness brings out that accent. Very interesting. She also made us some great oatmeal with goji berries and sunflower seeds that really helped me get going. \n\n4:31:30 PM: I really enjoyed meeting Finn. I didn't get to know him super well the first day I met him because he only stayed with Ocean and I for a few hours in the afternoon before going off to meet his couchsurfing host. I found that I really liked Finn though because he has the quiet and kind vibe to him. He really helped me out while staying in Iceland by sharing food and money with me. He gave me over 1000 kr to bring to the airport so that I could get some food before my flight took off and not starve until I get to Boston. Very kind because I did not get to eat any breakfast before leaving and I can't afford anything on this airplane. I will really like it when I get my credit card back from Drew. He has kindly agreed to come to South Station in Boston in order to return it to me. I feel glad that I did Drew's dishes before I left his apartment so that he felt happy to return the favor. Finn has a pretty interesting story. He came to the US to study at Princeton but really felt unhappy there because people did not have the level of social consciousness that he has. He heard about a program called Watson University in Boulder, CO which he visited for a few weeks during spring break. He liked it so much that he has gone to study there for good, leaving Princeton. Watson teaches social entrepreneurship something I consider very cool. \n\n4:40:06 PM: I feel really grateful for the small amount of music I have on my computer. Listening to this Gramatik track brings me way back to when I worked at Medtronic, when I first started listening to Gramatik on Console.fm. Good times. I did some strange stuff that summer. I remember having Calvin and his friend Craig over to Hightower during the basement flooding that happened. Poor Shaun, he just really couldn't catch a break. A lot of his books got destroyed due to water logging and mould. I really pissed off Shaun the night when Calvin and Craig arrived because I left a game of League of Legends in order to greet them. At the time Craig seemed like a really awesome league player to me, and he used the big metal dude with the spikes. Some other memories that have come up recently: almost getting caught masturbating by Dr. Shapiro at the Ross program when he and Daniel Ross came to my room. I guess that Daniel sniffed my packets and knew what I got up to. I really should have took the hint when I overheard him talking about how he could see people's traffic on the network. I really did a terrible job that summer, ah well. \n\n4:43:43 PM: Like Ocean I definitely want to continue my friendship with Finn. He wants to build an online nation, a notion that I fully support. I don't know quite how he will do it, but I want to help him however I can. I want to start building this idea of the digital tribe into my life. I have really felt blessed to get included in the tribe here at Thrive. I taught people bodyweight exercises. I felt like I had a lot more to teach but I didn't want to press. I learned a lot. \n\n4:46:03 PM: Ahh, such awesome music. Also, it feels great to write a lot. I think I would like to integrate the word counter features from NaNoWriMoApp into here. That way I can get a nice sense of the progress I've made in my writing, I feel like I have written a lot of words today. I feel excited to get back to DBC. I think I will greatly enjoy teaching with Steven Harms and together we can really fix up the phase two curriculum by a whole lot. \n\n4:47:55 PM: I have a bunch of transcription I should do because I wrote down a lot of nice ideas in my notebook during this trip. I also wrote down a nice long dream I had. I have a lot of work to do to make my iPhone wallpaper even more useful. I want to formulate my operating system and live by it diligently. I enjoyed seeing James Clear, which Sam Hysell hooked up for us. He works very hard on habits and motivations and provided the validation my current approach will pay dividends. I have certainly gotten stronger as I can now go into a headstand without using the wall. In fact I flow into it by going into crow first, which I find pretty fun. I will keep working on that and then also add in going into handstands soon, I think. I think I could make a splash by synthesizing the approaches of Convict Conditioning and The Naked Warrior into my own brand of strength training. I have a lot of interest in generating a series of youtube videos. \n\n4:53:43 PM: Thinking about paying my rent like this: bank -\u003e bitcoin -\u003e blackbank -\u003e cash -\u003e Josh. I have a lot of opsec to think over though. So far the way I've run things has a lot of sloppiness that I have to fix. I think I might have to go clear for a few months while I formulate a strategy for invisibility if I want to do it. But maybe I shouldn't even bother, because I have better ways of making money that don't involve so much risk taking. I still have the nine tabs that I came to Iceland with. I will have to try one soon so I can assertion the quality of the batch and see if I can trust the source. I feel excited to see the rest of my package that arrived while away that Daria picked up for me. Given the amount of leverage Daria potentially has I have to extract myself from our relationship carefully if I will manage to do so at all. \n\n4:57:04 PM: Generally speaking I have found the women in Iceland beautiful. I also like the architecture there and I admire how most of their country runs off of sustainable energy. We found it pretty interesting that all the hot water that runs in the taps smells like sulfur because it comes from hotsprings. Pretty smart that all the heating takes place in a sustainable manner. \n\n4:58:13 PM: I found a kindred spirit in Juvoni in a lot of ways. He had to hustle hard while young in order to escape poverty. He sounds regretful that his brother has dropped out of college, I didn't want to press the point. Juvoni has lived for 23 years so far. He will start a new job at AmEx very soon, I told him to look out for Jason Shapiro. On that note, I have a friend of Jason's that I need to help out named William Swift. He identified himself to me as a quarter black transgendered youth who lives on foodstamps. He definitely can't afford DBC normally. He got into DBC way back in November and he wants to get the #yeswecode scholarship now but LaTeesha apparently told him that it only exists for new applicants. Not sure what the hell to make of that. I need to talk to Melissa and LaTeesha about that. Hoping that Melissa can help me approach LaTeesha because I still don't feel totally comfortable with LaTeesha. \n\n5:01:36 PM: Kind of scary, I turn 23 soon. This year has gone by fast. I have built up my savings a tad, we will see how that goes. If I can stand to stay at DBC for a year and actually collect my full salary that would help my savings a lot. So far because of the way that I have started and stopped jobs and had to work my way up to raises I have really only made $95k/year for the past two years, significantly below my theoretical salary. I will have to see how I can better hack DBC if I want to stay there. Right now I think I need to equip it a little better if I want to use it as a training space for taijutsu. I will need to install a mirror there at the very least. I think I also need a proper desk and keyboard so that I can work in comfort there. And maybe I should bring my big headphones there so that I can work in peace. I can start to emphasize more that the students must not rely on me because if they do they will feel stunted when they get to the real world. My god, I love this playlist, how I had forgotten. \n\n5:05:10 PM: Turning my laptop brightness down so I can stretch the battery a little longer. I think I might switch activities for a little while to give my back some rest, but I have definitely enjoyed having some time to write out my thoughts, I feel like I haven't had a good chance to really journal for quite a while but I feel I should probably get more comfortbale doing it at DBC, especially since I have this sneaky stealth mode button and all.

In the reflection of the door they see the avatars they chose to display. Daphne, a slender black haired beauty:(in this day and age everyone had their brand of beauty) of Asian descent in a minimalist red dress that seemingly has no depth. Daphne liked to stay close to her fleshbod:(pre-rapture physical body) in appearance. Malcolm, a black velociraptor with purple stripes wearing a green beret. Daphne focused on the door and words formed on its surface. She filtered the relevant information.\n\n_Axiom Corp World ... Subjective Time: 6 months ... tagged: Alt-Hist, Dystopic, Rebel Hero, ..._\n\n\"Daphne, I don't understand Ur obsession with these alt-histories. Of all the worlds why keep jumping into pasts that never even existed?\"\n\n\"I want to understand how we got to here.\"\n\n\"So why not follow the real-histories?\"\n\n\"Real? How can we know? Who wrote the real-histories? How can we confirm them? All the evidence exists out _there_. I need to understand. Best I can do? Check all the histories, see how they match up to now. I need to experience all the theories.\"\n\n\"Why? Can't U just enjoy what we have here? I can experience anything I can imagine, better yet lots more I can't imagine but other people can. Won't U come enjoy the pleasure domes of ten thousand resort planets with me?\"\n\n\"I can only enjoy so much sensation before my mind dulls of it and I wonder, what meaning behind this? I remember the days before rapture, but after all I've seen I wonder, do I really remember? I have to understand.\"\n\n\"I can't stop U, of course. But six months subtime? A long time to go under in that miserable hole. U sure?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I want to do this. Perhaps this is just my style of hedonism.\"\n\n\"Enjoy then. Catch U on the way out.\"\n\nDaphne steps through the portal feeling confident, and amused at how a supposedly hardened hedonist like Malcolm still enjoys her companionship. Still human. We crave the human connection, and no number of fork tongued alien hooker battalions could change that.\n\n------\n\nYONK! YONK!

Naked in a space-foam bed with yellowing sheets sweating profusely. Dark metal room, hot and humid. Artificially white light from an LED sphere hanging from the ceiling, next to it ventilation duct, no airflow. Daphne instantly feels claustrophobic. Just room for her small bed, a cabinet, and a sink with a small mirror. No shower in sight. \n\nStill feeling groggy and way too warm Daphne swings her legs off the bed and walks over to the sink.

I've written up my times and my notes.  I've also included TODO items which I took to my Phase Lead (Matt Bunday) as things we need to alter our delivery to accommodate.\n\nPart 1:  33 minutes\nPart 2:  24 minutes\nPart 3:\n- Release 0: 55 minutes\n- Release 1 / 2:\n    - Auction Spec To Pass: 22 minutes\n    - Item \"\" \"\" \"\" : 5 minutes\n    - Last two \"\" \"\" \"\": 13 minutes\n\nRelease 1, Release 2 Notes:\n\nModel Specs\n\nThe specs in Steps 1/2 seem massively entangled.  You can't pass the model specs without the whole ecosystem of `setup` working.  I tried to to get `spec/models/auction_spec.rb` to pass.  But I blew up on the before().\n\nAs such, the model tests don't seem like guides in the TDD sense. They seem much more like a diagnostic for DBC on whether the student has implemented to specification. You can see the entanglement in:\n\nhttps://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-2-assessment/blob/master/part-3/spec/models/auction_spec.rb#L5-L14\n\nI have to wonder if most students will perceive this pitfall to productivity without coaching on \"how to take the DBC phase 2 test.\"\n\nTODO: Heavier emphasis on reading and implementing to specs\nTODO: Stress testing associations in model specs\n\nFactoryGirl Dependency\n\nIf I role play a student and try to use the specs to drive my development, I hit an issue. The specs have a heavy dependency on the indirecting FactoryGirl gem.  To wit, if I run the `auction_spec` again, I will blow up first on the `create()` call in the `before()` block.  This means I have to try to deduce what goes on in that block.  The language does not conform to what I've seen as a Phase 1 / 2 student.  Sam B. suggested that he could see students converting those lines to the conventional Auction.create(...).  I couldn't find a FactoryGirl call in the skills tree.\n\nTODO: Lecture on FactoryGirl\n\nBCrypt Assumption\n\nMany students have learned the chant `has_secure_password`.  The provided migrations do not work with that.  Instead an interface method needs set up or the student needs to implement the bcrypt interface on the model.\n\nThe skills tree does not have documentation on how to teach bcrypt, so I don't know what to do here.\n\nTODO: Show BCrypt by the numbers in a lecture\n\nRelease 3 (50 minutes):\n\nThis got mostly fixed by implementing the first two releases.  Got mostly fixed along the way.  Setting up the views etc. took about 50 minutes for me. I really felt tired now.  My mind wandered and I went for candy.\n\nTODO: I think that we will to have to counsel students on how to take the test.\nTODO: I think the stamina component will hurt students' performance here.\n\nRelease 4: 1 hour\n\nI gave up halfway through.\n\nThings started off OK.\n\nBecause an auction has a start and end date time I thought \"...ugh..really\"?  Writing date time view elements by hand?  omg.  I started down the path but found few / no good tools to help me create the date things.  And then I thought \"ok a field for start year start month start day start hour start time and thank god I have vim and I can write a recursive macro to do this...but the coding overhead of typing this view feels pretty damned hairy!\"\n\nI think building this view will prove a dangerous time-sink here.  If they don't get to this before lunch I think they will feel demoralized if they hit this point at the sugar-low time of the afternoon.  I predict tears.\n\nTODO: Lecture on building good form controls quickly.\n\nI went as far as building out a form by hand and submitting the params to the back end (figuring that my AR knowledge etc. would just work once I got the right params back).  This took about 40 minutes for someone who knows what to do.\n\nWe're dealing with auctions which means that we need to write controls for datetime which is a GIGANTIC PAIN.  I don't know how much implicit knowledge I brought to bear on this problem but I go things going pretty quickly, but I can see time / CGI control interface issues eating up a huge amount of student time.\n\nBetween nerves and implementing to a spec, I think the mean of the cohort will only finish Release 4.\n\nSpeaking as a teacher, I had other things to do at this point, but I have to speak honestly... I just don't want to do this anymore.  I actually entertained the thought: \"If I can't focus on doing this and churning it out quickly, maybe i need a different career.\"  Thankfully I know I can program and I feel good at it...but this assessment actually had me thinking otherwise.\n\nOther Releases\n\nOf the following 3 releases, I decided to bail.  In the spirit of \"expose my ignorance,\" let me \"expose my utter feeling of failure.\"\n\nI thought at this point \"This sucks\" and \"I suck.\"\n\nI feel tired and bored and I wonder how I will deal with getting my money back for DBC.\n\nConcerns:\n\nBased on this work, I consider it unlikely students will get to a fully fleshed-out version of the views.  I have huge advantages of knowing how to look things up, how to shortcut questions, how to get byebug up and running, how to do a fast n log n debug of a problem and get to the essential crux, etc.\n\nAt the time I quit, I'd used about 50% of the allocated time.  Let's assume that with experience etc. I work 2X faster from our average student (they may know associations better than me, but I probably debug faster).  Let's say I work (charitably to me) 2.5X faster than our average student...:shudder:\n\nI think this could prove a painful experience.  I predict:\n\n1) Leads will need to stay on the floor actively engaged all day (and worthless the next)\n2) Leads will need to teach to the test\n3) Teachers feel validated in their concern that Curriculum will implicitly define delivery by means of the assessment\n4) Student emotional impact will prove non-trivial\n5) Did our play-testers rock through this much faster than me?  Maybe I do suck at my job and I need to quit if they can do this in a single 8 hour sitting.\n6) Students won't feel ready to learn on Thursday\n\nI need to get back to tending the flock here, Matt has generously let me shirk my accountabilities while I did this, so I don't have time to recraft this, but I reported my experience and I'd recommend site leads and phase leads calibrate accordingly.","name":"0","updated":{"$date":"2015-04-16T16:13:32.227Z"}}

I also met a psychic named Kyler James. I asked him about finding my alchemical compliment. He had me pick two women I already knew about and leave the third a mystery. I said Ocean, and Daphne.

I still have a lot of hours left in which to do lots of cool stuff. I feel very freed now. I want to sprint to finish this InstaInk project, I think it would kick off my freelancing business in a major way if it succeeds. Had a great time in the park talking to Kyler, such an interesting guy. He told me a story about how every time someone has asked him \"What is the meaning of life\" he has drawn the Ace of Pentacle (kether in malkuth), the odds of that I calculate at just under 1 in half a million. Anyway, following up from our last tarot session which went like this (I asked for helping \"finding my alchemical complement\"):\n\nMe: High Priestess\nDaphne: Fortune\nOcean: Seven of Cups\nAliza: Queen of Wands, more fire cards\n\nHe seems to think I will meet Aliza soon, which I await.

Caught up with Charlie and Trey'von, briefly met Kate. Learned about this awesome folding keyboard from Mike and about Ohan's cool plan to start a school in Sri Lanka with an interesting education philosophy that attempts to contextual learning and make students understand why they would want to learn something by tracing the roots of knowledge through time. I think I might see William in twenty minutes, but I don't know for sure. I don't know if we meant to flake or what, but I wouldn't mind either way. I met a lot of beautiful women at Mike's party and felt very natural interacting with them. I think I have grown a lot in that department.

And I think I need to update my reading list with some of the books I finished recently. I had a pretty harrowing night last night, where I barely escaped with my integrity intact. Well, actually, I did fine, it didn't get that close. But I had a lot of women expressing interest in me and Sam did it very overtly. She definitely wanted to fuck me, but I will remain loyal to Daria while we remain together, and I didn't find her drunken antics particularly attractive, nor her general immaturity. As predicted Zack has started to undermine his relationship with Melissa. I don't think they will really hold together because he just doesn't have the maturity to stay with a woman that fine.

With curriculum busy working on assessments I will inform U about these new challenges and why we have found success with them. I hope to inspire U to incorporate some (if not all) of these into your phase guides, as I know U have the best intentions in mind for your students.\n\n### Therapist Challenge (https://github.com/Devbootcamp/therapist-challenge)\n\nI strongly recommend replacing the Deaf Grandma challenge in Phase 1 with this Therapist challenge. They hit upon the same learning competencies, but Therapist has a much broader potential. I've seen students really go wild with, starting to research natural language processing and other fun techniques. Deaf Grandma struck many of our students as both ageist and ableist, Therapist does not have either of those problems. In fact, Therapist gets people thinking in a positive frame of mind.\n\nI think U will all agree that the Therapist challenge poses a much more interesting and intellectually engaging set of problems than Deaf Grandma. I like Cheering Mascot too, and I feel glad to have it as an option thanks to Kevin and Torey's efforts. I certainly consider it an improvement over Deaf Grandma. I like Therapist even better because it introduces a bit of famous CS history and it feels less contrived and rule bound to me.","name":"1","updated":{"$date":"2015-05-04T19:05:08.256Z"}}

,{"_id":"bFJ9ddfKQZzvJxMbh","active":true,"url":"explicative_order","prose":"Y6S4h7YcnDWM9m3NK","text":"Thus, in the mind of Joseph Jacotot, a sudden illumination brutally highlighted what is blindly taken for granted in any system of teaching: the necessity of explication. And yet why shouldn't it be taken for granted? No one truly knows anything other than what he has understood. And for comprehension to take place, one has to be given an explication, the words of the master must shatter the silence of the taught material. \n\nAnd yet that logic is not without certain obscurities. Consider, for example, a book in the hands of a student. The book is made up of a series of reasonings designed to make a student understand some material. But now the schoolmaster opens his mouth to explain the book. He makes a series of reasonings in order to explain the series of reasonings that constitute the book. But why should the book need such help? Instead of paying for an explicator, couldn't a father simply give the book to his son and the child understand directly the reasonings of the book? And if he doesn't understand them, why would he be any more likely to understand the reasonings that would explain to him what he hasn't understood? Are those reasonings of a different nature? and if so, wouldn't it be necessary to explain the way in which to understand them?\n\nSo te logic of explication calls for the principle of a regression ad infinitum: there is no reason for the redoubling of reasonings ever to stop. What brings an end to regression and gives the system its foundation is simply that the explicator is the sole judge of the point when the explication is itself explicated. He is the sole judge of that, in itself, dizzying question: has the student understood the reasonings that teach him to understand the reasonings? This is what the master has over the father: how could the father be certain that the child has understood the book's reasonings? What is missing for the father, what will always be missing in the trio he forms with the child and the book, is the singular art of the explicator: the art of _distance_. The master's secret is to know how to recognize the distance between the taught material and the person instructed, the distance also between learning and understanding. The explicator sets up and abolishes this distance--deploys and reabsorbs it in the fullness of his speech. \n\nThis privileged status of speech does not suppress the regression ad infinitum without instituting a paradoxical hierarchy. In the explicative order, in fact, an oral explication is usually necessary to explicate the written explication. This presupposes that reasonings are clearer, are better imprinted on the mind of the student, when they are conveyed by the speech of the master, which dissipates in an instant, than when conveyed by the book, where they are inscribed forever in indelible characters. How can we understand this paradoxical privilege of speech over writing, of hearing over sight? What relationship thus exists between the power of speech and the power of the master?\n\nThis paradox immediately gives rise to another: the _words_ the child learns best, those whose meaning he best fathoms, those he best makes his own through his own usage, are those he learns without a master explicator, well before any master explicator. According to the unequal returns of various intellectual apprenticeships, what all human children learn best is what no mater can explain: the mother tongue. We speak to them and we speak around them. They hear and retain, imitate and repeat, make mistakes and correct themselves, succeed by chance and being again methodically, and, at toto young an age for explicators to being instructing them, they are almost all--regardless of gender, social condition, and skin color--able to understand and speak the language of their parents.\n\nAnd only now does this child who learned to speak through his own intelligence and through instructors who did not explain language to him--only now does his instruction, properly speaking, begin. Now everything happens as though he could no longer learn with the aid of the same intelligence he has used up until now, as though the autonomous relationship between apprenticeship and verification were, from this point on, alien to him. Between one and the other an opacity has now set in. It concerns _understanding_, and this word alone throws a veil over everything: understanding is what the child cannot do without the explanations of a master--laster, of as many masters as there are materials to understand, all presented in a certain progressive order. Not to mention the strange circumstance that since the era of progress began, these explications have not ceased being perfected in order better to explicated, to make more comprehensible, the better to learn to learn--without any discernible corresponding perfection of the said comprehension. Instead, a growing complaint beings to be heard: the explicative system is losing effectiveness. This, of course, necessitates reworking the explications yet again to make them easier to understand by those who are failing to take them in. \n\nThe revelation that came to Joseph Jacotot amounts to this: the logic of the explicative system had to be overturned. Explication is not necessary to remedy an incapacity to understand. On the contrary, that very incapacity to understand. On the contrary, that very incapacity provides the the structuring fiction of the explicative conception for the world. It is the explicator who needs the incapable and not the other way around; it is he who constitutes the incapable as such. o explain something to someone is first of all to show him he cannot understand it by himself. Before being the act of the pedagogue, explication is the myth of pedagogy, the parable of a world divided into knowing minds and ignorant ones, ripe minds and immature ones, the capable and the incapable, the intelligent and the stupid. The explicator's special trick consists of this double inaugural gesture. On the one hand, he decrees the absolute beginning: it is only now that the act of learning will begin. On the other, having thrown a veil of ignorance over everything that is to be learned, he appoints himself to the task of lifting it. Until he came along, the child has been groping blindly, figuring out riddles. Now he will learn. He heard words and repeated them. But now it is time to read, and he will not understand words if he doesn't understand syllables and he won't understand syllables if he doesn't understand letters that neither the book nor his parents can make him understand--only the master's word. The pedagogical myth, we said, divides the world into two. More precisely, it divides intelligence into two. It says that there is an inferior intelligence and a superior one.

They are both awesome, technical, and passionate about helping us learn the material. Thank you!\"\n\n\"having tanner and matt as my teachers, matt is a zen master and tanner is all around an awesome dedicated teacher\"\n\n\"For a teacher like Matt! Everyday I can honestly say that I am inspired by him and I don't think I've ever said that about anybody. He's not only a great teacher, but a humble and patient one ALL the time.\n\nOn Thursday we had EE with Matt who introduced us to \"The 'L' Word\". This was a fantastic EE session where had the opportunity to discuss discrimination we have faced individually and to share it with a group.  It was the only other time in other than week 3, where I actually felt the most empathetic for those around me.\n\nI would suggest that this EE session with Matt should be replaced with the first week's regarding \"sexism\" because it seemed that the way the first session was presented brought a lot of division into the group, especially for a group of people who don't really know each other very well. \"Sexism\" is an important topic to discuss, but it was presented to us in such a way that women and  only women in tech experience it, which is obviously false. An EE that is more relatable, less biased, and presented with no anecdotal and nonsensical examples would be a much better introduction to engineering empathy in my opinion.\"\n\n\"Matt led an impromptu EE to this effect which everyone loved and found very valuable. It also felt more in the spirit of the other, more 'intense' EE sessions.\"\n\n\"I sometimes look around and there aren't any teachers around to help. I think having more people around to help would be great! I also wanted to comment on the first EE session we had about sexism in tech. We did that EE again in a different way with Matt and I thought that was done much better. We went around the circle talking about how discrimination has affected each one of us. It helped us bond more as a cohort and enabled us to view the topic from many different lenses. When I first did that EE, I was a bit apprehensive to share my views and I almost felt like certain views were really being pushed down our throat. That wasn't the case when we did it again.\"\n\n\"Matt did a great EE on discrimination and compassion last week. I felt it dealt with what the sexism EE was pointing to, but for everyone, rather than just one subset of people who deal with discrimination.\"\n\n\"I want to specifically touch on the sexism EE (the first one in Phase 1) in comparison to \"The L Word\" (most recent EE), taught by Matt Bunday. The L Word in my opinion is a considerably better alternative to the sexism EE. The former EE focuses on the concept of all differences between people rather than a specific difference (e.g. gender), which made the L Word easier to relate to and a better experience. Additionally, this EE was not divisive like the sexism EE and left everyone feeling quite good. Matt encouraged all students to say \"I love you\" after each one of us shared a time we had been discriminated against. From listening to other students, I learned the depth and breadth of different kinds of discrimination and felt enlightened at the end of the hour. In comparison, the sexism EE was difficult for me to relate to and I left that EE feeling as though my time had not been well spent. I encourage DBC to replace the sexism EE with Matt's \"The L Word\" and would be glad to discuss further for anyone who wants a more in depth explanation.\"\n\n\"Matt \u0026 Sam have also be around to helps out when we can get there attention.\"\n\n    when :ken\n      \"Thanks for not only instilling your vast knowledge upon us, but also always trying to bond with us as a friend and fellow geek.

She shifts slightly and I admire the elegant shrug of her shoulder.\n\n“Hey, what time is it?” she whispers.\n\n“About two thirty, give or take,” I murmur.\n\n“Okay,” she says. For a while we admire the night sky. In these wetlands we are spared the glare of artificial lights, and the stars seem embedded in a crystalline canopy of constellations.\n\n“What are you thinking about?” I ask.\n\n“Oh, back when I wrote poetry, this would've been exactly the kind of scene I'd want.”\n\n“Why not write it now?”\n\n“I don't write anymore.”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“It doesn't work for me anymore. The words are never as haunting as the memory—I don't want to mar the image.”\n\n“But the point of writing something down is so it stops bothering you—that's why it seems less haunting after you've written it down.” A breeze blows through the cattail stalks and rolls over us, and her scent mixes with the musk of earth. I can feel her warmth in contrast with the cool air, and I glance at her.\n\nShe takes a moment to respond. “I guess I want to be haunted, then,” she says quietly. I'm sure now that I love her; I just need to tell her.\n\n“Come on, I'll help you. I'll start.” I clear my throat, “In the moonlight the cattails sway…” \n\nShe just laughs at my 'poetry voice'. “I'm just cursed to carry around these memories.”\n\n“If you insist,” I say, with mock resignation, “Speaking of curses, I think I might be cursed, too.”\n\n“Sure, and how's that?” she turns to face me.\n\n“My natural charm,” I grin, and she rolls her eyes. “People I say 'see you tomorrow' to keep disappearing.”\n\n“And you never see them again?”\n\n“Right. I had the same bus driver for three months, then one day on a whim I said, 'thanks, see you tomorrow' and the next day, he's not driving the bus anymore. I spent a week getting to know the new driver and then I said 'see you tomorrow' to him too. Now I have yet another bus driver.”\n\n“Have you tried it on people other than just bus drivers?”\n\n“Oh, yes. I've also had a librarian, a waitress, and an intern disappear. I was planning on removing that phrase from my vocabulary forever,” I pause for effect, “but then I had a far better idea.”\n\n“Yeah?”\n\n“I decided I'd just say it to people I don't like.”\n\n“Oh, I remember now, you mentioned trying an experiment yesterday. So did it work?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“I guess the curse wasn't fooled by your reverse psychology.”\n\n“No, I suppose not. Would have been nice, though.”\n\n“Yeah. Did I ever tell you about the time my mom was pregnant with my sister?”\n\n“No. Tell me about it?”\n\n“Sure, your experiment reminded me that I tried something similar. You'll like this, it was when I still wrote.”\n\n“All right then, let's hear this story.”\n\n“When I was younger I had some fanciful ideas, and—”\n\n“So you were a child once too.”\n\n“Oh hush, now this is going to sound ridiculous.”\n\n“Go on, who's to think you're ridiculous out here?”\n\n“You are. Well, anyway, back then, I used to write a lot of poetry. I was eleven at the time, and I was lonely. We had a large house, an old victorian mansion. It was usually empty, since my parents were always out on business—mergers and acquisitions. My brother was sixteen and he always had places to be with girls his age. I really wanted a little sister, or brother, I wasn't about to be choosy about my company,” she pauses.\n\n“Are you more choosy now?”\n\n“Yes, quite.”\n\n“Lucky me.” I grin.\n\nShe smiles, then goes on, “Behind the house there was a creek I'd often go to. There was a spot where the wind had blown down an oak tree, and it spanned the creek. I'd sit on that tree to be alone.” She paused again, looking wistful. “And I would just dangle my feet in the water.”\n\n“To be alone. That explains my meeting you out here,” I say and she smiles. Traces of her wist remain, in her eyes, the corner of her lips, the arch of her brow.\n\n“Yes, it does. Anyway, one day I found a notebook at the other end of the tree, hidden where the tree had been uprooted. It was new, there was only one story in it.” \n\n“What was the story?”\n\n“It was about a Djinni that searched the world from the Andes to Ural and from Copenhagen to Vienna searching for someone to articulate a beautiful vision. He would make this vision reality. But the story wasn't complete—when I found it was left off right in the middle.”\n\n“Left off where?”\n\n“I remember the exact sentence still. 'Atahqua considered the young girl before him. He beckoned the child to speak,' and that's where it left off.”\n\n“So you filled in the next part?”\n\n“Naturally. I filled in a prose poem for the little girl's dialogue. Of course, I imagined I was her, and I wrote about wanting a little sister, then I put the book back where I'd found it. I dreamt that it was a magic book that answered my wishes. But even then I thought it was childish, so I didn't think much of it.”\n\n“That's reasonable.”\n\n“Yes. But when I found the notebook a week later there was new chapter written. The Djinni granted the wish, and the characters were ecstatic. But what's more, my mother announced she was pregnant that same day.”\n\n“Remarkable.”\n\n“Of course, it was pure coincidence. She was pregnant even before I'd found the notebook. But given my limited information there was only one logical conclusion. The book was clearly magical.”\n\n“Clearly,” I tease.\n\n“Clearly, and—hey, I was eleven, okay?”\n\n“I haven't forgotten.”\n\n“I was overwhelmed by the responsibility that came with possessing a magic book. I spent an entire month devising paradise, and then writing it down in florid detail.”\n\n“Tell me what paradise was like, later.”\n\n“Sure. I went and wrote everything into the book, and waited. After a week, nothing had changed.”\n\n“What about the book?”\n\n“Well, the story in the book continued, and it was beautiful, but it was just a book.”\n\n“But who was writing it? Unless the book was magical, just not how you thought.”\n\n“Ha, no, I snuck up on the author one day when he was writing.”\n\n“Oh? What was he like?”\n\n“Jonas was nice.” She half shrugs, and looks down.\n\n“Yeah?”\n\nShe touches her shoulder, as if to brush something aside. “Have you thought about how crazy it is that we met?”\n\n“I have, a bit. What are the odds that two night walkers would meet out here?”\n\n“Well, probably not that different from two space probes finding each other up there—” she gestures at the sky. “Such a huge expanse of emptiness.” I roll onto my back and gaze up. The night is a soft wash of the deepest of blues and purple, freckled with distant galaxies. “Except instead of exchanging golden etched disks of our cultural achievements, we made do with awkward greetings.” I chuckle.\n\n“All of that space up there. It's not exactly empty. Just—lifeless. In the gaps there are points of frantic activity, but not the kind a probe is looking for.” We lay still. I hear the cicadas' cadence, and the loons' lament. I can feel the breathing of the marsh, its soft exhale.\n\n“Makes me appreciate this warm earth here. Can you hear how alive this place is? Up there everything is so harsh. You have your cold vacuums and your hot stars, but there is no temperance.”\n\n“You know, I think our odds were better than the space probes have, now that we've considered it.”\n\n“Yeah, guess so,” she says, sounding a bit distant. I lose myself in the surroundings, and try to work up my courage.\n\n“What do you think of self-fulfilling prophecy?” I say, turning over to look at her again.\n\n“What's the prophecy?”\n\n“If someone thought he'd always be alone, and because of that he's bashful and quiet, for example.”\n\n“I think that's rubbish.”\n\n“Why's that?”\n\n“Most prophecies come true even if you fight them. But with a prophecy like that, fighting back is all you need to break free.”\n\n“All right, then.”\n\n“Why do you ask?”\n\n“Aliza, would you mind if I told you a story?” I finally manage.\n\n“Have I ever?” She props her head under her arm and looks at me. I shift a bit, flustered.\n\n“So,” I break eye contact. “For many months, before I'd met you, I waited with this cute girl for the bus in the morning. I got to know her a bit. I was always reserved, but she would initiate conversations. Gradually, we got to be friends. We'd talk each morning, and it was nice. I…”\n\n“You…?”\n\nI search for the right way to say it. “I had a painful crush on her.” I'm confused by Aliza's amusement, I guess I hoped for something else.\n\n“Well, of course, that tends to happen.” She smiles.\n\n“Yes, well, one particularly foggy and dark day I stood next to her and I decided that I've waited long enough. I was going to ask her out on a date.”\n\n“What happened?”\n\n“Oh, this is a terrible story. I shouldn't tell it.”\n\n“No, it's fine. I'm listening.”\n\n“All right.” I wince. “I stood there, and I looked out at the highway before us. The way the burning headlights drove through and lit up the fog made the highway look like a streaming river of fire. All I could think about was how I wanted to throw myself into the rushing river, be enveloped by the light, feel the waves washing over me, picking me up into the flow and flinging me along, tumbling, and finally I'd come to rest at the side, like a pebble along the riverbank.”\n\nShe places her hand on my shoulder. “I'm glad you didn't,” she says, after a moment.\n\n“Well, thanks. I just couldn't handle the pressure, so I never asked her out.”\n\n“Did you say anything to her?”\n\n“Yes. I said, 'see you tomorrow.'”\n\n“Oh.”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“So, are you feeling okay?”\n\n“I'm fine,” I sigh, “the point is—and I'm sorry I'm being indirect—is being with you doesn't feel like that. I'm nervous around most people, but comfortable with you.”\n\n“I'm sure it's just the circumstances. That's why we go out at night, to get away from it all. Here, you can escape, that's why you are comfortable with me. It'd be the same with her, if she was here.”\n\n“I don't think so. You are the first person I've felt this way about. And she wouldn't go out walking at night—only you would do that. I'm in love with you, not the night.”\n\n“Oh,” she says. She looks distraught. She studies my face. She turns away.\n\n“Aliza, what's the matter? If you don't feel the same way, I'm sorry I ever brought it up.”\n\n“I can't be with you. I'm not over him,” she says, finally.\n\n“Who?”\n\n“You asked me about Jonas earlier.”\n\n“Who is he to you?”\n\n“He was a storyteller, whereas I was a mere poet. His description wasn't as evocative as mine, but his characters were. He would blow humanity into dialogue and action and characters would become beings of flesh and bone. Behind their movements was the subtlety of emotion and thought. They lived.”\n\n“I guess he made quite an impression,” I say, more bitterly than I intended.\n\n“After we finished the book we sent each other letters, and then we started meeting. We waited to start dating, for a while. Those were the happiest years of my life.” She adjusts her jacket for a bit, while I pick at the ground with my foot. “One day is particularly clear in my memory. We'd been dating for a few months and Jonas said he had a surprise for me.”\n\n“What was it?”\n\nShe shivers. “He lead me through the forest, to somewhere unfamiliar. We reached what seemed to be a clearing, and I just gasped.”\n\n“What did you see?”\n\n“I was standing in the shadow of an old limestone belltower. The base was covered in ivy, but it still gleamed white, and was engraved with scenes of supper and gaiety. Jonas said it was his hideaway.”\n\n“Did you go inside?”\n\n“Well, we pushed through the curtain of ivy that took the place of the missing door and ran up the steps. Then we sat down in the belfry, trying to catch our breaths, and just grinned at each other. Everything was perfect.”\n\nI can't hear it, but I see her shoulder shake. She's crying. “What was the matter?”\n\n“I wish that, out of the blue sky, lightning would have struck the bell—a peal of thunder and of bells—and frozen us in that moment forever,” she says finally. She turns toward me, wiping her eyes with her sleeve.\n\n“I don't understand. Isn't the belltower still there? You could still visit it.”\n\n“The last time I went back the grass was brown, the ivy had withered, and the satyrs and nymphs were worn away. The tower looked like a skeletal finger thrust through the earth, and it wore a ring of thorns.”\n\n“I'm sorry.” I look down, I can bear neither her gaze nor the night's. The swamp is silent, holding its breath in, like it overheard our conversation and is suddenly ashamed.\n\n“It's not your fault,” she says at last, but her voice is hollow. “Not unless you cause brain aneurysms.” She clutches a clump of grass and rips it out.\n\n“Pity it is a clear night out.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Because we never got our chance at lightning. This was perfect, wasn't it?”\n\n“It was nice.”\n\n“But I messed up.”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“Can't we just forget that I did, and go back to before?”\n\nShe shakes her head. “It'll never be the same.”\n\n“I know. But we'll still enjoy ourselves.”\n\n“It's changed, it'll just be different,” she says as she stands up. I scramble up after her.\n\nI look up to gaze at that night sky I found so beautiful. But she's right, something has changed; the stars lie flat and dull against a dismal darkness. I look back at her, she's still the same gamine.\n\n“Please don't go,” I say, but I see the wounds in her.\n\n“I'm sorry.”\n\n“I'm the one who should be sorry. I had no idea.”\n\n“It's fine. Maybe you were right, I have writing to do, I've been haunted for long enough.”\n\n“It was nice knowing you. Can you just answer one question?”\n\n“Depends on the question.”\n\n“Will you ever be over him?”\n\n“No. Maybe.”\n\n“Will I see you again?”\n\n“That's more than we agreed on,” she says. For a second she smiles. “But probably not.”\n\n“Can I ask a favor, then?”\n\n“Oh, why not?”\n\n“Could I have something to remember you by?” I ask. \n\nShe looks through her bag, pulls out a book, and hands it to me. “Aren't you forgetting something?”\n\n“I wouldn't put it past me.”\n\n“You wanted to know what paradise was like.”\n\n“I was hoping you meant a farewell kiss.”\n\n“Oh, you. In paradise, whenever two peoples' happiness come into conflict, they would each go in living parallel realities where they are happy.”\n\n“What did the Djinni think?”\n\n“He said he was a being of finite, if immense, power.”\n\n“Pity, it would have been handy just now.”\n\n“That was just a story, you know.”\n\n“For all I know, so was everything.”\n\n“You know that's not true.” She looks hurt.\n\n“I'm not sure I do.”\n\n“Well, will you remember me, regardless?”\n\n“Always. You sure this is goodbye forever?”\n\n“I'm certain,” she says and turns away. “And hey, stay cool, you'll meet some nice girl one day,” she adds, over her shoulder. \n\n“Okay then, see you tomorrow.”\n\nShe smiles sadly and walks to the trail. I consider following her, but she knows I go the other way. I sit in the dark, holding that book, before I walk home.\n\nAlong the way, every little thing reminds me of her. I used to go out walking to escape. The void of night would swallow my melancholy; the vastness would make my emptiness insignificant. I would be primal again. Now there's no escape. In fleeting shadows I see her dancing figure, in the crisp air I still smell her scent, the brush of a breeze beckons with her touch. The night itself carries her imprint.\n\nFinally I reach city streets again. Under a streetlight I examine the book. It's a worn anthology of poetry. Inside the cover is written “Property of Jonas Coffrey” in a neat letters. There is a bookmark, so I open the book to the marked page. There are several annotations in a feminine hand, which Aliza must have written. One poem has been encircled with a floral design.\n\n      Separation\n\n      Your absence has gone through me\n      Like thread through a needle.\n      Everything I do is stitched with its color.\n\n      — W.S.

Power through embarrassment, shame, guilt.\n6. Cultivate gratitude.\n7. Find the opportunity in every moment.\n8. Cherish the time U have with Ur friends and Ur family.\n9. Remove addictions, build habits.\n10. Laugh at everything, especially Urself.\n\n## With more elaboration\n\n1. Learn whole-heartedly. Don’t ever learn something half-assedly. If U do, later U will realize when U need to know it, but not know it. This will cause regret. Just learn everything. Ur brain has the capacity. Trust me, U still remember so much stupid trivia about systems U don’t interact with anymore, such as Magic: the Gathering.\n2. Feel curious about everyone. U may think that shyness saves U time in human interactions, because U only interact with people U deem high quality, but really U just miss opportunities.\n3. Make fear Ur training partner. Follow it or hunt it. If U don't choose situations where U feel afraid, U stay complacent and stagnant.\n4. Strike a balance.\n5. Power through embarrassment, shame, guilt, and other fourth circuit socio-sexual emotions. They can serve other people, but U don't need them. Society uses these emotions as brakes on what would otherwise turn into an out of control acceleration of innovation. As an innovator U will shrug off these feelings and keep working.\n6. Cultivate gratitude. Appreciate all U have, thank everyone who helps U.\n7. Eradicate negativity from Ur mind. Find the opportunity in every moment. Sometimes U just have to shift perspectives to find it.\n8. Cherish the time U have with Ur friends and family. U don’t know how much of it U will get in the future.\n9. Remove addictions, build habits.\n10. Laugh at everything, especially Urself.","name":"2","updated":{"$date":"2015-11-19T19:59:35.207Z"}}

To see let's shift our perspective and wording.\n\nI live in a city where wizards with long beards and unfashionable clothing stay in tall black towers using ancient esoteric languages like FORTRAN and C and Ruby to usher forth electronic djinnis to do their biding. In other towers law and finance mages animate corporate golems such as Goldman Sachs to their own nefarious ends, bounding up thousands in their elaborately wrought runework of contracts. From shopfronts bearing the sigil of the mermaid, we may obtain a steaming brown elixir which grants us wakefulness and concentration.\n\nMost people have in their house a black mirror. Using a wand with many knobs they can scry and see into far flung corners of the world. Most people carry pocket scrying mirrors so that they may telepathically communicate with their loved ones over any distance. Many scrying mirrors have electronic djinnis trapped within, duty-bound to serve their master by reminding them of appointments and other miscellany.\n\nWalking amidst the promenades of New York I can descend into underground caverns, where I can step into the stomachs of long metal serpents which burrow through the city, delivering me to my friend's doorstep.

Truly I live in a wonderful magickal world! And I feel fortunate to ply my craft as a PROGRAMMER, a mage that speaketh the machine tongues, an animator of the scrying screens. How lucky I am!","name":"1","updated":{"$date":"2015-11-19T21:28:24.871Z"}}

I’ll get to the metaphorical level later.\n\n[Your Brain On Porn](http://yourbrainonporn.com/) can explain the scientific reasons why pornography and masturbation will do to you (I do not subscribe to a fundamentalist Christian or a moralist dogma in any sense, I base my reasoning on physiology) far better than I can, so I will let it.\n\nI like to focus on the positive, so instead of listing the drawbacks of masturbating, I’ll just list the benefits of abstaining that I’ve experienced. Please, in the spirit of science, verify these benefits for yourself.\n\n* Increased confidence\n* Increased muscle gain from working out\n* Increased alertness\n* Increased interactions with women\n* Increased drive to improve my life\n\nMost of this I can simply directly attribute to the increased serum testosterone one gains after about a week without orgasm. Pretty nifty. I would say it has made me ‘cockier’ and ‘ballsier’—turns out, words have meaning, funny isn’t it? \n\nBelow I list some effects that don't feel chemical in nature, but instead feel psychological.\n\n* No more porn shame\n* No more fear of getting ‘found out’ by others\n* Self-respect from knowing that I’ve conquered my last addiction, the oldest and deepest rooted one that has stayed with me for years\n* Real women seem way sexier when I don't mentally compare them to a surgically enhanced model with the aid of professional lighting, makeup, acting, video editing, and other tricks used by the porn industry\n\nI relapsed on Valentine’s Day 2013, a silly mistake to make. I’m never looking back. Testosterone feels like a hell of a drug.\n\nNow, on a more metaphorical level, masturbation can take a lot of forms. Think of any habit you have that feels fun and comfortable, but never gets you further in life. For me these comprised video games, TV shows, movies, marijuana, cigarettes, etc. I’m happy to say that I spend the majority of my time on activities that I find challenging, that I can improve at, and that I think will aid me in the longterm.\n\nFor additional help, I've linked to a [subreddit you may find useful](http://www.reddit.com/r/nofap).","name":"2","updated":{"$date":"2016-08-26T04:33:13.103Z"}}

Two of them don't even require faith!\n\n### 0. I exist.\n\nWhile U read this U may realize how obvious it seems that U exist.\n\n### 1. U exist.\n\nI use ‘U’ as a general term. It can mean ‘you/U’ in the conventional sense of another person, or ‘U’ as in the Universe at large.\n\n### 2. I luv U\n\nI consider this the only tenet that requires any faith. Living as a lover requires only that U internalize this and apply it wherever possible. Let’s say that as U make breakfast, U happen to contemplate Ur toaster. Since Ur toaster exists as a ‘U’, U say to it, “I luv U”. Then, as U walk out the door U see Ur neighbor, and U say “I luv U”.\n\nSometimes U might see something U don't know U love. U might ask Urself, “do I luv U?” Have faith! Just remember, “I luv U”. It doesn't take much!\n\nLovism doesn’t have complicated rules like, “Thou shalt not murder”, because all that gets covered by “I luv U”. Just remember that “I love U” and then do as Ur heart guides U.\n\n## Lovism FAQ\n### Do I have to love my manager?\n\nI luv U.\n\n### What if I feel angry?\n\nHave faith. I luv U.\n\n### What if sometimes I hate my parents?\n\nTell them, \"I luv U\".\n\n### How do I convert more people to Lovism?\n\nTell them \"I luv U\". Lovism doesn't really care about proselytizing because regardless of whether someone else follows lovism, U must luv them. That said, leading by example usually wins people over, so just luv lots of people!\n\n### Sometimes I feel depressed. Can lovism help with that?\n\nSure, just tell Urself “I luv U” and smile. Go tell other people \"I luv U\" too, it'll feel great.\n\n### Doesn’t ‘U’ piss U off? It pisses me off.\n\nI love U. U can just spell it ‘you’. I just try to make a point about the Universe.

Next I built a production front-end with React + Redux and setup ESLint, Webpack, Babel, Sass, as well as our i18n solution. I built a Facebook-esque real time chat interface. I mentored two members of our development team. I also built the foundation of a React Native iOS application.\n\n### Google\n\nSoftware Engineer: July 2015 to Feb 2016 in NYC, NY\n\nI developed features for an unreleased Android application, maintained two popular 20% projects which I inherited, and I briefly worked on a data processing pipeline.\n\n### Dev Bootcamp\n\nTeacher: April 2014 to June 2015 in NYC, NY\n\nI teach Ruby fundamentals, then Sinatra, and finally Rails so my students understand and appreciate the complexity of Rails. Similarly, I teach SQL and then ActiveRecord. I also teach meditation, breathing techniques, emotional empathy, and other topics essential to peak performance in engineering, along with TDD and a basic agile workflow.\n\n### Sailthru\n\nDeveloper: May 2012 to March 2014 in NYC, NY\n\nI started out at Sailthru as a [HackNY](http://hackny.org) fellow. During my internship I wrote a testing framework in Ruby and automated  manual UI testing. After my fellowship I stayed on as a full time employee in the Horizon, API, Link team. I implemented real time list counting and real time email statistics. I moved to the Backend team where I implemented our integration with Netsuite and streamlined our email campaign generation process.\n\n### Medtronic CardioVascular\n\nSummer Associate: May 2011 to September 2011 in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota\n\nI programmed a touch screen interface for Medtronic's next generation hemeostasis machine using C# on Windows CE. Surgeons find hemeostasis machines essential during surgeries to balance the level of anti-coagulant (heparin) used. I also worked with Medtronic's medical researchers to provide data from the machines that they used to develop formulas to determine how much heparin to use.\n\n### University of Minnesota Computer Science Department\n\nTeaching Assistant: August 2010 to December 2010 at Minneapolis, Minnesota\n\nI taught a section of CSCI 1103: Introduction to Java, graded homework and tests, and held office hours. I found Java a poor pedagogical language, so I supplemented the syllabus with Ruby to give a contrast to Java, and to better illustrate basic algorithms and OO principles. I feel proud to say my students did well on their tests, because they learned computer science instead of memorizing Java syntax.\n\n### Ross Mathematics Program\n\nJunior Counselor: June 2009 to August 2009 at Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio\n\nI taught number theory and abstract algebra, graded problem sets, supervised activities, and attended seminars in hyperbolic geometry, computability theory, and Galois theory.\n\n## Education\n\n* University of Minnesota, 2008-2012, Mathematics and Computer Science\n* Stanford University Education Program for Gifted Youth Online High School, 2006-2010\n\n## Selected Projects\n[ImpishIdea](http://impishidea.com)\n\nI founded this self-sustaining community (I now have no active role in it) based on community management techniques I learned over several years. When I first launched it I successfully Google-bombed the search term “Brisingr Review”. This brought me many page views and ruined a major book release.\n\n[TactfulTokenizer's Github](http://github.com/zencephalon/Tactful_Tokenizer)\n\nThis Ruby library performs sentence tokenization quickly (10x speed improvement over the equivalent Python library, splitta) and accurately (99.8% on the Brown corpus) using a naive bayesian statistical model. It avoids pitfalls such as “Mrs. Jones works in the U.S. Senate and at 5 p.m. she has an appointment with Dr. \n\n[ZenWiki's Github](https://github.com/zencephalon/zencephalon-mt)\n\nThis wiki engine powers my personal website. It features a Git-like tree based revision history, wiki-link autocompletion, extensive keyboard shortcuts, autocompleting search, and other niceties.\n\n[Self-Mastree's Github](https://github.com/zencephalon/Self-Mastree)\n\nA tree based life-tracker for optimizing my life.","name":"22","updated":{"$date":"2016-11-01T20:56:02.670Z"}}

The spring grass tickled her neck as she leaned back, and repositioned her black beret. Beside her, Neal ruffled his blond hair, looking for a ladybug which had crawled in. Nora daintily inserted two fingers into his hair, plucking out the bug. With a slight smile, she flicked it into the open sky, and watched it buzz into emptiness. She saw no clouds, but dandelion fluff floated in the sea of sky, as if trying to fill in, before the breeze swept them aside. The breeze flowed in a lazy wave, around and above the contours of the rolling hills. \n\n“I'm bored,” Nora announced. \n\n“Yeah?”\n\n“Yeah, aren't I always?” she said, sitting up and leaning forward. Neal pushed himself up. \n\n“Pretty much. What do you want to do about it?” Neal brushed some grass off his back, and picked up the beret, which had fallen again. \n\n“You know the cellphone tower?” she said, pointing. She knew she didn't need to point, everyone knew where it stood. You could see it from anywhere in the town. Amid the cornfields, the prairie grass, and the homes, atop a larger than normal hill rose the tower. It seemed an obelisk of steel, a monolith of engineering. A little cousin of the Eiffel Tower, right in the middle of nowhere. Mounted atop the four-legged tower, among the massive altar of antennas, nestled a blinking red light. Nora stared intently at that light. It always sat there, mocking her, challenging her with its regular beat. \n\n“Obviously,” he said. \n\n“I want to climb it.”\n\n“What? Why?”\n\n“I'm bored, it's there, I haven't done it before.”\n\n“I don't know, climbing that thing could be dangerous.”\n\n“Those bars look pretty evenly spaced to me. Easy,” Nora shrugged, looking up and down the structure of the tower. From this distance, atop the hill, it didn't look that high, but she knew it would seem different looking from the base of it. \n\n“I don't think those bars were exactly designed for climbing.”\n\n“It's not like I was expecting monkey bars or anything, it still doesn't look that bad.”\n\n“You aren't even any good at monkey bars,” Neal said, poking her in the belly. Nora jumped slightly, and the beret slid off her short black hair. She gave him a cross look. \n\n“Sure I am.”\n\n“Yeah, that's why you were always losing hold in the playground.”\n\n“I wasn't any good at monkey bars,” she said, “but that was years ago, plus monkey bars don't have footholds. Also, I'm stronger now.” She punctuated the point by punching him in the arm. Neal laughed, while wincing. He snatched the beret and scrambled to his feet, running. \n\n“Bastard!” Nora took after him. \n\n“Come on, let's go see if there's a movie playing.”\n\n----\n\n“I can't believe we wasted an entire afternoon yesterday watching that terrible movie,” Nora said, sitting backwards on a chair, looking out the rain soaked window at the dark skies. In the clouds, she could see the faint red pulse of the tower, beckoning. \n\n“It wasn't that bad, we've seen worse.”\n\n“The writing was shoddy, the acting was wooden, most shots were bad, the pacing was off in the second half, and that actor had a mole on the upper lip, totally distracting.”\n\n“Did you have any better ideas?” Neal teased. He was lying down on the old yellow coach, legs up on the arm. \n\n“Yeah, I did. I was going to climb the tower. I'll just have to do it today.”\n\n“You are absolutely not climbing today, end of story.”\n\n“Yeah, and why?”\n\n“Because you would be swept off, and I'm not good at catching falling people.”\n\n“Then I'm doing it the first day it doesn't rain, or else right away,” Nora grinned, Neal scowled. \n\n“I'll certainly miss the sun, but here's hoping it never stops raining. This is dangerous.”\n\nNora got up from the chair, and paced. \n\n“I know, I know. But it'll be okay. I've been thinking about this for a while.”\n\n“A while? Like, two days?”\n\n“No Neal, longer than that,” she said. “Anyways, you are right, I'll do it when the weather is clear, and no wind. I don't want any cross wind when I'm up there. Climbing the bars won't be hard, this isn't a shear cliff, the tower is angled, so I could even pause if I got tired.”\n\n“What if you get electrocuted? You'd be climbing all sorts of electronics up there,” Neil said, sitting upright on the couch. Nora walked into the kitchen without bothering to turn on the lights, she knew her way around. She opened the fridge, revealing the little frightened light hiding from the darkness outside, and looked inside. \n\n“Yeah, but don't birds hang out in there? They would be dropping like popped balloons if there were anything dangerous up there,” she said from the kitchen. \n\n“Jesus. Get a good pair of gloves then, leather or some other tough material. I don't want you ruining your hands grabbing sharp metal crossbeams.”\n\nNora emerged from the kitchen, grinned at Neal, and sat down to hug him around his shoulders.\n\n“I think you're out of milk.”\n\n“Alright, just promise me you'll keep safe. What if I lost you?”\n\n“You'd be just fine.”\n\n“I can't even buy milk unless you remind me, Nora.”\n\n“Oh, big deal,” she laughed. \n\n----\n\nThe sun shone bright, and Nora felt the slightest breeze that still smelled of fresh rain. Neal and Nora walked up the hill to the tower. They made hushed small talk until they reached the concrete base of the tower. The grass abruptly ended in a crisp edge of poured concrete, and from the concrete emerged one leg of the tower. The other three bases formed a square with this one, and the sides were sixty feet across. They stepped onto the base, and Nora placed her gloved hands on the first bars. \n\n“Good luck, and please don't hurt yourself,” Neal said. \n\n“Thanks, see you back down in not too long,” Nora said, as she grabbed the next crossbar and positioned her feet. She climbed rapidly, hand over hand, foot over foot. It felt like climbing a tree, the hand holds and foot holds were so frequent and easy. A giant metallic tree, but it grew upside down, Nora thought when she reached the point where the four legs joined into the trunk. Here she paused for a moment, the majority of the climb still ahead of her. Feeling her breathing settle down, she shifted sideways to get from the leg to the center of the central spire, and continued up. Hand over hand, foot over foot, it took ages. Her arms began to tire, but she didn't slow her pace. As she got further up, the bars occurred increasingly frequently, they were widest apart where the spire was broadest. Each time she grabbed the next crossbeam, she felt grateful for the gloves. The edges of the metal were harsh, and she knew she would have cut her hands climbing. The gloves provided her good grip as she got to the increasingly vertical part of the tower. She paused again to look up. Only twenty more feet. The last few went quickly, and Nora hoisted herself up, on to the little platform where the array of electronics stood. \n\nAnd among it she saw the flash of the huge red light. Nora stared it down for a moment, then turned her back to it, before it blinded her, grinning in silent success. She threw her arms in the air, as if herself an antenna. And up there, among the bombardment of radio-waves and micro-waves, Nora felt interconnected to all the world, as though pieces of her body scattered across the four corners of the land. She felt each individual molecule of her existence vibrating, up there in the open. They cried out for release into space, each electron straining for broadcast into the universe. She shuddered, then drew in a large breath, as if to pull herself back in and together.\n\nShe looked down at the landscape with new eyes. Everything seemed so small. Of course, because of the height, but she held out her hand, and imagined holding the entire town. All her life, she had stayed constrained in this tiny space, a place so much smaller than the dollhouse she once played with. She lowered her hand and stood still for a time. \n\nThe trip down took longer and felt more difficult, because the possibility of slipping. Nora moved down in a trance, not entirely aware of her motions. The landscape didn't seem to grow in size as she approached, it still seemed small. When she reached the bottom, and had her feet on the ground again, Neal embraced her and held her close. \n\n“I'm so glad you are safe. I didn't lose you.”\n\n“I wouldn't be so sure,” Nora said. She had meant it to sound playful, but it came out hollow. She choked for a moment, afraid, she squeezed back. \n\n----\n\nIt had been a week since Nora climbed the tower, she knew because they just watched the “new” movie released. After the credits scrolled by, everyone but Nora and Neal had left the theater. They considered themselves completionists; they watched movies for the holistic experience, trailers, movie, credits. They stood up, they sat in the first row, always. Together they loved the eye straining, in your face intensity of the front row, where you couldn't escape the scene however you tried. As Nora strolled up the aisle, she strolled down memory lane. She let her hand slide over the arched backs of the soft red theater chairs, as she recalled the movies they had seen here. _Forest Gump_, _Schindler's List_, _Pulp Fiction_, _Braveheart_, the gems among the muck. She paused in the middle of the aisle, having finally decided. Neal noticed. \n\n“What's up?”\n\n“Neal, I think I want to move.”\n\n“Where?”\n\n“Far away, probably.”\n\n“Far?”\n\n“Farther the better. Let's get away from this place.”\n\n“Nora, you know I can't leave, this is home. My roots are here.”\n\n“I know,” she said, “I think I always knew.”\n\n“Why do you want to go?”\n\n“I can't just stay here and not do anything. I've got to try things, it's so constraining not to.”\n\n“But I'm here for you, everyone is.”\n\n“I know, you'll always be here,” she said, “You'll be here if I come back, I know. You've my anchor, my fallback. I feel safe knowing you will be here.”\n\n“Nora, there is plenty to do here, you don't have to leave.”\n\n“There's nothing here, I've got to move about,” she said. “Here, keep this for me,” she handed him her beret.\n\n“So I am losing you. I knew when you said that thing, it was there in your voice. Promise me you'll keep in touch.”\n\n“I'm so sorry,” she said, hugging him. “I promise you I'll call. I'll remind you to buy new milk and everything.”\n\n“Yeah. We get great cellphone reception here.”\n\n“Oh, please don't be like that.”\n\n“Then do one thing for me, promise me you'll go see the Sundance Festival. Do it for both of us.”\n\n“I promise. I'm so sorry Neal.”","name":"3","updated":{"$date":"2017-01-26T23:51:20.495Z"}}

A mind that does not carry the weight of expectation, but has the eagerness of a child. A mind full of curiosity, not yet jaded.\n\nAnd it makes good sense to cultivate such a mind. Sometimes I wonder if we could re-embrace the openness and curiosity of children, could we not learn as quickly as they do once more?\n\nOf course, this attitude runs into difficulties when we consider an attribute of wisdom that grows with experience, that of discrimination. As we age we realize that we have limited time and that what we learn will assist us most if we can assimilate it into our existing models of the world. And it will not do to endlessly soak up information that we consider useless. I have left behind the days when I would gleefully learn by sight hundreds of Magic: the Gathering cards, not only learning each of their individual effects but also pondering their endless combinations.\n\nAs children we can willingly learn anything and everything because we have the blessing of trusted parents who help us find choice information. As we gain independence we must decide for ourselves what to invest our mental capacities into. So we must strike a balance between curiosity and discrimination, and between openness and caution.\n\nBeginner's Mind has another meaning, one I find even more powerful. What does a beginner do, except begin? The hardest part of practice, I find, consists merely in beginning, again.\n\nIf we can keep the Beginner's Mind and just begin again, again and again, always beginning our practice, then we can go far.","name":"0","updated":{"$date":"2017-02-10T00:45:35.375Z"}}

,{"_id":"dNct6eLhz8FgEefT8","active":true,"url":"a_stones_fall","prose":"pkSttn3uRmFuLY9h4","text":"_The Medieval period, and in particular the Dark Age, is often considered an ignorant time, especially with regard to superstition. But are we any less superstitious than the Medieval man? Our superstitions only rarely feature occult influences, it's true. Due to the association between superstition and the occult we are less able to recognize our own superstitions. In this paper I will demonstrate that superstition can be explained by the cognitive theory of denial. A superstition is merely a lie for our own comfort._\n\nI step out of the stairwell into the crest of the tower and my skirt flares in the wind. I glance around. The eight encircling gargoyles have their winged backs to me. They are gentlemen, then. But one of them is postured differently, stooped far forward, hind legs barely gripping the masonry, one arm stretched out toward the street below. I walk over. The gargoyle might be grabbing or throwing, I'm not sure.\n\nI peek over the parapet. They say this is where the boy fell. Or jumped, depending on who you ask. Thomas died on December 18th. I grasp hold of the gargoyle's leg for support, and lean over the side. It isn't hard to imagine how he died. He fell over one hundred twenty feet. Right into the neat boy-outline down below.\n\nA gust of wind shoves me forward. Staring down, the outline stares back. My heart skips a beat and in my panic my hand slips. I flail, trying to grab something before it's too late. Pitch forward into empty sky. Fall head first. Grab the gargoyle's outstretched arm. Hands ripping down his forearm. I brace for a shock. Hits my shoulder. Jerk to a stop. I'm hanging by my left arm. My wrist is caught in the gargoyle's grasp, my hand is clenched around its wrist. It—he—stares pityingly.\n\nMy feet dangle for a bit before I recover my wits. Reach up and grab his claw with my right arm. Kick off my heels. Don't watch them fall. The wind howls at me, but I swing toward the wall. Barely hook the ledge with my toes. I'm still hanging out in the open, but at least some pressure is off my arms. Try to pull myself up a bit. Left arm is useless. My shoulder may be dislocated, but it doesn't hurt yet.\n\nStarting to feel numb, have to act. Get closer to the wall, try to get more surface along the ledge. Kick off and pull hard, my head is level with the stone fist. Can't support my weight for long, grab the gargoyle's elbow with my weak arm. Hold on just long enough for the right arm to catch, before I slip. Hanging off the elbow I pull myself up again until I can wrap my thighs around his hand. I shimmy up the length of his arm. Use his cupped fingers as a foothold, his ear as a handhold. Finally I scramble onto the tower.\n\nI suddenly feel colder than I've ever felt, like all my insides have been replaced with frigid air and I'm just a woman-shaped container. I can't stop shivering.\n\n_For a Medieval peasant reality was grim. Life expectancy was in the low forties[4]. No wonder, then, that it was comforting to think, “Satan cursed my harvest to die. But if my children are devout, they can avoid my fate.” Of course, there was no chance for social advancement, so a peasant's children will be no better off. This is mirrored in our society, where the comforting device is the American dream. “I didn't get the job because I've no college degree, but if my children are studious they can avoid my situation,” is the thought of many working parents. But a child born in the lowest quartile has only a seventeen percent chance of moving up a quartile[5]._\n\n“So, what is the yarn, Natalie?”\n\n“I don't think this'll be the sensational story you want. From here the gargoyle doesn't look like it pushed the kid, at all. Maybe it could've done like an over-the-shoulder judo throw, but I can't see it. You know how these things are. So a single person dies, but it's really nothing, and everyone keeps adding to the story. I mean, sure, the gargoyle seems to have changed positions in these photos. But to go from ‘boy commits suicide near odd gargoyle’ to ‘boy is murdered by gargoyle’? It seems a bit loony. Why don't I just research this as a regular suicide story? Then we can leave out the gargoyles.”\n\n“Why don't you like the story?”\n\n“That gargoyle just saved my life, so I guess I'm a bit biased.”\n\n_Left and center. A photo of the Thanksgiving day parade passing the cathedral. Very few photos have a view of the rear tower (the facade is considered the architectural highlight). Note that the gargoyle is squatting the same way as the others. Right and center. A photo showing the new position of the gargoyle, taken after the second and third murder._\n\nThis office is all dark mahogany and plush leather, and there is no hint that any paperwork is actually done here. The headmistress of the school, Ms. Petrich, sighs deeply and looks down—and I notice her trying to read my reaction.  “No, Thomas was a completely average student. Average performance in class, liked by his peers but not popular. There was really nothing we could have done to prevent that senseless tragedy. If only there had been some sign, maybe we could have helped him. But it can happen to anyone, that's what is so terrible about suicide, you have got to understand.”\n\n_Thomas received an A for his work in this course. I was impressed with his great originality in thesis topics, which he was able to follow up with good efforts in research and write-up. Thomas was well prepared for each class, and it is clear that he did the readings before class. A few colleagues of mine have said he looks bored in class, but I think this is more an effect of his classmates than of his classes. He could signal that better by being more active in raising his hand, but it is understandable that he doesn't wish to stand out. Thomas seems exceedingly mature for his age, and his analytic style has managed to challenge even some of my own assumptions._\n\n“Yes, I'm Michael. We hung out.” He looks around quickly. There are other students walking down the halls. He lowers his voice. “Not a lot at school though, he didn't want the two of us to be associated, or they might figure us out.”\n\n“Figure you out how?”\n\n“That we were the two scholarship students. Not that it matters, because we fit in here like sore thumbs fit in square peg holes.”\n\n“Why wouldn't you want people to know if you won a scholarship?”\n\n“It's a full ride scholarship, for low-income students. Not something you announce to everyone if you're going to a school where the median income is two fifty Ks.”\n\n“Do you think Thomas got along well with people here? Was he having trouble fitting in because his family is poor?”\n\n“Of course he didn't. And he didn't fit in because he isn't a douche.”\n\n“Strange that Ms. Petrich didn't mention either the scholarship or the social problems he had.”\n\n“Yeah? Well, I bet you she didn't mention the huge foundation grant either.”\n\n“No, she didn't. What do you know about it?”\n\n“Doesn't it seem a bit strange that there are only two students here on scholarship? Seemed strange to us, because if they were really committed to helping poor kids like they say they are, then how come they are only helping two? Even though their broachers talk about how much diversity there is here, socioeconomic included. Well, you can pretty much see,\" he waves his hand towards the other students, \"how much diversity there really is here. So Thomas started looking around, and he found out that the McCarmac Family Foundation has half a million dollar grants for private schools to ‘advance the educations of low-income students.’ Seems like they are doing the bare minimum to get the grant money, and putting the rest in the endowment fund. Well, now they are panicked, because they've got to find a replacement student to put on scholarship.”\n\n_The Robert McCarmac Low Income Initiative Grant: awarded to schools that demonstrate a commitment to helping the disadvantaged achieve an excellent education. As a condition to receiving this grant the schools must name two low-income students as Robert McCarmac Fellows and grant them full scholarships._\n\nI sit down in the scuffed chair that is offered me. The apartment is meager. It looks like it is normally well kept, but has recently suffered neglect. \n\n“Thank you for agreeing to meet with me. I know this must be a very hard time for you.”\n\n“It has been very difficult. But I want the world to know that Thomas was the best son I could hope for, so how can I help you?”\n\n“I was hoping I could read Thomas's journal or diary, if he kept one. Otherwise just his papers. This will remain strictly confidential, of course; we would ask your permission to publish anything we find to be of interest.”\n\n_Mom went to the doctor today. First time in a long while. The checkup didn't find anything, so she's stayed lucky so far. If she got breast cancer or something I don't know what we'd do. Probably stop eating for a while. Sabrina's mom just got a boob job, according to Michael. Too bad she never does anything besides drop Sabrina off at school. At least with this new job I'd be able to help a little._\n\n“Thomas? Yeah, he was a good kid. Always got to work on time, didn't leave early. Since my job is just making sure people do those two things, he was cool with me.”\n\n“Did you notice anything peculiar about him?”\n\n“What, other than that he arrived on time?” he laughs. \n\nI smile, but cock my head.\n\n“Well okay, there was something else. The very first week he worked here he got the company life insurance. It's a popular thing to do, 'cuz it's a nice policy, but you don't usually see kids getting life insurance. I mean, what's the point, right?”\n\n_XII SUICIDE. The BENEFITS payable are limited if the INSURED commits suicide, regardless of sanity, within two (2) years of the issue date. In such cases our liability will be limited to the return of all PREMIUMS paid._\n\n“Hi, this is Natalie again. Sorry to call so late, but I had a question.”\n\n“It's no problem. We haven't started preparing dinner yet.”\n\n“Have you received any letters from an insurance company recently?”\n\n“We received a letter saying that a claim was still being processed, but we don't have any idea what that is about.”\n\n“It seems that your son purchased an insurance policy on himself, and named you the beneficiary.”\n\n_Michael and I have it all figured it out now. We're both paying our life insurance premiums with our jobs, pretty cheaply too, because we're not at risk of anything. But I think we can't wait two years, so we'll have to set something up._\n\nThe medical examiner's office smells faintly of embalming fluids, despite being strictly separate from the morgue. It'd be less disconcerting if it weren't so cold here.\n\n“Yes, I've kept the case file open, because there were injuries that were anomalous with a blunt trauma suicide.”\n\n“Could you be more specific?”\n\n“That's not something you hear often as a mortician, but sure. His shoulder was dislocated, forearm broken, and his wrist partially pulverized. Of course, you might expect that from a long fall, but he landed on his legs. His legs were shattered, and then he bled to death. His torso wasn't greatly damaged, so those injuries look out of place. These seem to have occurred shortly before the suicide.”\n\n“And that could be evidence of a violent struggle, then?”\n\n“That's right. Although you would need a hell of an arm to pulverize a wrist, so I don't know what sort of attacker could do that.”\n\n_We have a pact. I'm sure I can trust him on this. He knows where I'm coming from, after all. It just makes sense. We aren't going to be railroaded like everyone else. All my life I've had my path chosen for me. Because of where I was born I was instantly limited in what I could do. Eventually this narrows and narrows. The more invested you are in your path, the more loss averse you are. You can't switch courses, it's too late. That's how my mom is. She's stuck. I'm going to make the one choice that is truly mine. I know I can't live the path, I'd be too unhappy not making choices. Better that I make a choice that can set someone else free. There's no American dream for me. I started out behind, so people need only work as hard as me to be ahead. I'm going to beat them to the end, though. My choice is to fall._\n\n“Michael, did you, or did you not assist Thomas in trying to disguise a suicide as a murder?”\n\n“I didn't!\" he shouts. Fortunately no one else is in the park.\n\n“Then why is Thomas dead? I know you two had a pact. You should—”\n\nMichael is sobbing. Maybe I was too hard on him. “The pact wasn't for me to help him. We were supposed to commit suicide together and make it look like a double accidental homicide. Then our insurance policies would both payout, and be processed in a week. In time for Christmas.” He takes deep breaths of air and regains some composure. “But I chickened out. I thought for sure that if I didn't show up he wouldn't go through with it, and if I did show up to tell him to stop he'd just convince me all over again. I was so scared. He was probably so disappointed that I didn't come that he decided to just kill himself.”\n\n_I spoke to Thomas's mother again. She received a letter saying an insurance claim was being processed. Which means it hasn't been determined whether his death was a suicide or something else. Maybe it is unethical, but I think I'll push for a homicide in my story. That way Thomas will at least have accomplished what he set out to do._\n\nI didn't believe Michael's story, but I feel uneasy, like I've missed something obvious. My heartstrings tug at me. I pace around in my hotel room, trying to burn the nervous energy. I touch my wrist. It's still tender from the fall. Then I realize. I sprint out the hotel and hail a cab.\n\n_Benefits Paid: $570_\n\nI step into the tower again, out of breath and desperate. I see his silhouette in the darkness, standing on top of a parapet. “No! Michael, don't do it!”, I shout while running toward him.\n\n“Why shouldn't I? I let him down. I shouldn't be here, I should've been there. Everything he worked toward was ruined.”\n\nAs he steps off I lunge and hug him around the torso. For a moment we are safe, but then his weight pulls us both down. “Sorry,” I whisper to him. Then I see it. The gargoyle moves so fast it is a blur. It holds us tight against its chest.\n\nIts wings are flapping, but we are still falling. I squeeze Michael tight and look up into the night sky. So many stars, but only one earth. Falling is not much of a choice.","name":"2","updated":{"$date":"2017-10-13T00:52:57.427Z"}}
